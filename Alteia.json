Half-elf men do have facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven ancestry.

That specific outlet is the control over fate that seeing the future can provide, though it typically comes at a grave cost of being incredibly frail, since the training and mental exercising that is required for this both takes up all your free time and allows for little in the way of staying in shape. Worse yet, practicing for so long can make it difficult or even impossible for some seers to live for the present, always instinctively making plans for the possibilities they think of even when the dangers seem to of passed. Hopefully you'll become powerful enough to fix that, but it's very well possible that you won't live that long. Seers are often the target of good and evil creatures alike trying to steal the edge that comes with this ability, and without being either secretive or very clever about using your powers, you could easily get in over your head."

Like all priests, they dedicate much of their lives to worship - but they derive their power from the Void, straying dangerously close to the domain of the Old Gods. To truly understand such ancient, corruptive influence is to be driven mad.

However, when casting a spell from the schools of Evocation or Transmutation with the Shadow Current, the range of the spell is decreased by one half, any Check or Save incurred by the spell has its DC decreased by 2, and if the spell deals damage then its damage is decreased by one die to a minimum of one die.",
					"When a spellcaster uses the Shadow Current to cast a spell that creates darkness, the size of the area of darkness created is also doubled. Additionally, these spells cannot be dispelled. The Shadow Current cannot be used to cast a spell that creates light under any circumstances.",

Additionally, the recipient of the healing spell must make a Constitution Save DC 5 + the level of the spell cast on them + the total amount of healing provided to them, receiving a level of exhaustion on a failure.",

An anti-magic field however counters all magic within its area and that includes the Shadow Current and its wielders. Shadow Current spellcasters must overcome any resistances that a creature might have and their magics are still subject to damage immunities as well. It is also harder for a normal spellcaster to perceive, counter, or dispel spells created with the Shadow Current, but at the same time it is harder for a Shadow Current user to affect spells created using the Aetheric Current; any check made to perceive, counter, or dispel a spell with the opposing Current must be made at disadvantage. Any Magic Item created using the Shadow Current is a Shadow Current item and therefore affected and subject to the same benefits and limitations as a Shadow Current spell."
