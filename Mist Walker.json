			"The Elf exhales a final breath to ready herself. In a flash she disappears, only to reappear behind the unexpecting headsman. A shroud of mist covers her true actions, and in a matter of seconds she and the doomed man she was hired to save are running along the rooftops, making their way to the safehouse.",

Spotting a robed half-orc wielding a glowing staff, she reaches out her hand and soon a red swirl of mist appears around her   and the half-orc.

Speed and surprise are a Mist Walker’s greatest asset, which is probably why so many favor a pair of shorter blades — though some Mist Walkers still prefer to fight with shield, knowing that they so often find themselves behind enemy lines.",

As such, most Mist Walkers receive some form of formal training— whether through their service in a standing army, an apprenticeship in an order of assassins, or perhaps they were cultivated from birth in the ancient traditions of their remote mountain village.",
					"When creating a Mist Walker consider their upbringing and how they might have had access to such unique training. The environment in which they were trained, as well as their instructors, will typically have a significant impact on their personality and overall world view.",

How would your Mist Walker decide to put this new power to use? Why would they feel the need to study an, ultimately, deadly martial art form? Is it to gain an edge over a rival? Or perhaps it’s because they had a specific use in mind, and they needed a way to escape quickly."
