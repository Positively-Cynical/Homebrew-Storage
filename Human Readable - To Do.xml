		Description
		A nymeiral is usually a large, polished crystal as tall as a man, though it may take other forms as well. Like a nymeir, a nymeiral creates a city-sized envelope of pure magical energy. Unlike a nymeir, however, a nymeiral always incorporates a major special ability that permits the creation and use of quasi-magic items.
		Quasi-Magical Items
		Quasi-magic items function exactly like normal magic items within the bounds of a nymeiral but become inert when taken beyond its borders. The Kyneran arcanists who first discovered and used nymeirals viewed this restriction as a fair tradeoff, since the creation cost of any quasi-magic item, no matter how powerful, included no material components. This lack of a cost opened up item creation to even low-level spellcasters and made the creation of vastly powerful, near-artifact items such as floating mountaintop enclaves feasible. Without nymeirals, Kynera would never have reached the zenith of magical power that it achieved.
		Powering a Nymeiral
		Nymeirals require immense amounts of power to remain active, how the Kynerans powered them is unknown.
		Nymeiral Radius
		A nymeiral emits an aura of magical energy with a radius of 5 miles.
		The Dangers of a Nymeiral
		Touching a nymeiral is a potentially lethal decision. Anyone who touches the device must succeed a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or be instantly slain. Anyone that is killed in this manner cannot be revived by any means, as their essence is absorbed by the nymeiral.
		Any item that touches the nymeiral, except the stand that contains it, is instantly disintegrated.
		Any undead that touches the nymeiral is instantly and permanently destroyed.
		Nymeiral Effects
		A nymeiral has one effect from the Nymeir Effects table below:

		You begin to perceive the immediate potential future of a single target. A moment-to-moment pre-image of their impending actions are visible to you even as they move to enact them. As a result, you are able to anticipate and react to their actions, both aggressive and defensive, faster than they can compensate. If you attack them first, you will gain Advantage on the attack and end the Cantrip. Otherwise, the target gets Disadvantage on all attacks made against you until the Cantrip ends.

		When this spell is cast, the caster is attuned to turbulence in the timestream and can scan a 90-degree by 90-degree area (one eighth of a sphere) each round while concentrating. After locating an anomaly, the severity can be determined by concentrating on it for an additional round. The caster has a 5% chance per level to recognize the cause. On the demiplane of time, distance is not a factor, and the spell detects the nearest source of turbulence in any scanned direction. On a Prime Material, Elemental, or Outer plane, the range is 90 feet per level. In both cases, sight is also a limiting factor. The spell can effectively be maintained for as long as the caster concentrates.

	<description>
		The caster is able to determine approximately how old a specific non-living object, item, or material is. This could be a small statue, furniture, weapon, food, etc. If used on the dead remains of a lifeform, the results will indicate how long it has been dead. Immediately, the caster gains a sense for eras: Current age, some previous age, future age. The DM determines what constitutes an 'age' in that reality. If concentration is held for an entire round, the estimation becomes accurate to the century. For the next level of accuracy, the target item must be touched at some point. As concentration is held approaching 1 minute, age of the item can be known with accuracy somewhere between 1 decade and 1 year.
		For higher accuracy, the item must be touched, and contact with it maintained for the entire duration of the spell. If touched or held for the full 5 minutes, accuracy may be possible in terms of months.
		The degree of accuracy possible, regardless of how long concentration is maintained, is always determined by the DM. Some items may simply be too hard (or perhaps too powerful) to estimate at scales smaller than centuries, for example. On the other hand, some items may be trivial to determine, and accuracy to the day (or even hour) might be possible, perhaps even without the full 5 minutes of concentration.

		Channelling energy from the demiplane of time, the caster causes two contradictory possible immediate futures to both be realized simultaneously for a target creature. Whatever actions the creature takes for the next round, they gain Advantage on all rolls. All rolls made against the target, including contesting rolls, have Disadvantage.
		This spell requires more focus than the average concentration spell. In combat, or in highly stressful or frantic situations, the caster can concentrate as normal for only up to 1 round. In calmer situations, the caster can concentrate on maintaining the spell for up to 5 minutes.
		The caster cannot target themselves with this spell.
		The material component for this spell is a small sealed container whose contents cannot be directly observed.
		At Higher Levels:
		You can target one additional creature for each additional slot level above 1st.

		Duration: 1 week / level
		Area of Effect: Up to 3 creatures touched
		A creature sent into suspended animation by the caster sleeps in a torpid state for as many weeks as the caster desires (up to one week per caster level).  A successful Constitution save negates the spell.  If affected, the creature's need for oxygen, food, water, and such are all but negligible for the duration.  Additionally, so long as asleep, the creature bleeds out much more slowly if wounded, and requires a Death Check once every hour, instead of once every round.  The creature can be awakened, but will go back to sleep when it is no longer interrupted unless it makes another saving throw.  When the spell expires, the creature will awaken with a very intense hunger.  The caster can affect 1 Large creature the size of a bear, 2 Medium creatures, or 3 Small or smaller creatures.  Humans and humanoids are as vulnerable to the spell's effects as any other creature.  Sentient or quasi-sentient plants and plant beings will go dormant if subjected to Suspended Animation, just as they would in winter.  Elves and Half-Elves will enter a state of deep meditation.
		The material component is a piece of ice, handful of snow, or patch of fur taken from a mammal while in hibernation.
		Based on the 2e ADnD Druid spell Hibernate.

	<description>
		Slow Metabolism:
		When cast on a creature, this spell can drastically increase the length of time between required meals. The recipient only requires food and drink once every 12 hours per level, up to 7 days. Also, if the creature has been poisoned, this spell slows the onset of damage and effect by one hour per level (assuming the full effect of the poison has not already take place), but a cure still needs to be found.
		The material component is a small wafer that the recipient consumes.
		Haste Metabolism:
		The reverse of the spell requires an attack roll. It quickly weakens a creature from lack of food and water. If a Constitution save is failed, the target's Constitution and Strength are each reduced by 1 point for every two levels of the caster (minimum of 1), until the victim next eats a full meal. This does not kill the victim unless the Hit Dice modifier drops it below 0 current hit points.
		The material component is a piece of spoiled food that is hurled at the target.

		Preserve:
		By the use of the Preserve spell, the caster can halt the decay (including shelf ripening) of any nonliving matter. In the case of food or drink, the substance must first be placed in a closed container of some kind. Preserve is dispelled when the container is unsealed. For other material, the spell runs its full duration unless dispelled by some other means. If the target is a corpse, it must be packaged completely in a container (sack, trunk, etc), and a spell slot of 2nd level or higher must be used.
		The material component required is a small vial of salt sealed with wax.
		Decay:
		The reverse of this spell, Decay, causes immediate decay equal to one month per caster level.
		The material component required is a pinch of dung or mold.

		Upon casting this spell, the caster may gain general knowledge of a single event to come. The event must affect the caster in some way. (An event that would affect another character in the party might count, especially if the caster relies on other party members for safety.)
		The chronal range is six hours into the future per caster level, and the spell automatically centers on the most important event in that time range. Information is frequently misleading--the caster might discover that gambling will bring good fortune, only to discover after losing 50 gp that the winner wishes to hire them for an adventure--and there is always a 10% chance that the information is simply wrong.
		The material component is a rose quartz held to the caster's forehead.

		Post-Image:
		When Post-Image is cast, the target is surrounded by a thin magical aura that bends time slightly, causing the person's image to appear one second behind the present. This distorted view of the target disorients attackers, and gives the recipient +2 AC and +1 to saves against direct magical attacks. This spell can be used in conjunction with other AC-affecting spells, but it is not cumulative with itself.
		Pre-Image:
		The reverse of this spell, Pre-Image, creates a false image of the target from half a second into the future. This disorienting effect gives the target +2 to hit, and increases their spell DC by +1, as opponents misjudge the target's movements and attacks.
		At Higher Levels:
		With more experience, the caster can strobe the image between past, present and future, increasing the disorienting effects.
		Caster level 5: Post-Image grants +3 AC, +2 saves vs direct magic attack ; Pre-Image grants +3 to hit, +2 spell DC
		Caster level 10: Post-Image grants +4 AC, +3 saves vs direct magic attack ; Pre-Image grants +4 to hit, +3 spell DC
		Caster level 15: Post-Image grants +5 AC, +4 saves vs direct magic attack ; Pre-Image grants +5 to hit, +4 spell DC

		Focus on an object or feature in sight. As the caster concentrates, their left eye begins to witness time in reverse, seeing further and further into the past. Simultaneously, their right eye begins to see time progress at an accelerated rate, seeing further and further into the (currently-most statistically-probable) future. Through their left eye, they might see burnt paper unburn, and become readable, then as time continued back, watch the words 'unwrite' themselves off the page, leaving a blank parchment. They might see people or creatures pass through a space in reverse. Through their right eye, they might see an unused new journal begin to form words on its pages as they 'write themselves' in, then after some time, get torn, or scribbled over, or fade. This might allow the caster to view the combination of a currently-secured lock at some time when it was (or will be) solved and open. They might also attempt to read a lost spell scroll, or examine a destroyed piece of evidence. Maybe determine what someone else is planning based on what they write, or how an object will be primed in the future, and then prepare against that outcome beforehand.
		Area of Effect:
		Typically, this spell is cast and then the caster spends all of their attention on the focused-upon object or area. However, the caster may wish to look around at their surroundings with anachronistic vision, or even walk about and observe the area as it once was or likely someday will be. This requires a Wisdom saving throw of DC 15. Failure means the caster becomes disoriented with a sense of vertigo, and must cease movement and focus solely on the original target of the spell in order to avoid losing concentration. They cannot attempt to look around at their surroundings again until the spell is cast anew.
		Rate of Change and Control of Flow:
		For the entire round spent actually casting the spell, the caster sees the past/next 24 hours (4 hours per second). They may change or pause the perceived flow of time by performing a Wisdom save, as though 0 rounds have passed so far. After this first round has passed, the caster may change the rate of the vision once per round.
		Rates are:
		> > > > Stopped,
		> > > One second per round,
		> > One minute per round,
		> One hour per round,
		One day per round (DEFAULT),
		> One week per round,
		> > One month per round,
		> > > One year per round,
		> > > > One decade per round,
		> > > > > One century per round
		Each attempt to change this rate may only shift over a number of rate categories equal to or less than the caster's Wisdom modifier. Each change in rate prompts an immediate Wisdom check of
		DC (9 - 1 per every 2 caster levels) + (number of rounds spent concentrating so far) + (number of rate categories attempting to change this round)
		So for example, shifting from days/round to full-stop is a difference of 4 rates. If the caster is Level 3 and was concentrating for 6 rounds at this point, then the DC is (9 - (level 3 / 2)) + 6 rounds + 4 rate = DC 18. Shifting from centuries/round to full-stop after concentrating for a minute would be (9 - (level 3 / 2)) + 10 rounds + 9 rate = DC 27. A level 20 caster would attempt the same shift as (9 - (level 20 / 2)) + 10 rounds + 9 rate = DC 18. Shifting one rate category per round prompts more checks, but each check will have a lower DC to contend with, and may be necessary for lower-level casters who wish ultimately to shift across many rate categories.
		Failing this Wisdom save causes the caster to immediately suffer a debilitating migraine for 1d20 minutes (Disadvantage to all Int and Wis skills and saves). This also immediately ends the spell, unless the caster chooses to suffer one level of exhaustion. No rate shift can be attempted while the caster is suffering a migraine, and additional castings of this spell automatically fail until the migraine clears.
		Observing only events of either only the past or only the future exclusively requires the caster to cover or close the opposite eye. Casters missing one or both eyes, or otherwise blinded, can actually still see out of the appropriate eye socket(s) for the duration of this spell, and still need to go through the same physical motions to block one side or the other.
		The material components of this spell are a piece of red glass and a piece of blue glass, each of which are held up to the caster's eyes.

	<description>
		The caster pulls from the demiplane of time a swirling orb, 4 inches in diameter, made of the mist-smoke of that plane, which is then hurled at a target. The rotation of the momentum of time causes havoc on impact with any object or linear creature.
		Damage: The caster makes an attack roll. It that attack roll hits, the orb deals 2d8 damage as random parts of the target accelerate, pause, slow, or reverse in time, causing significant temporal stress.
		Damage may be increased by casting with higher level spell slots.
		Effect: In addition to this damage, the normal flow of time is disrupted for the target, causing their senses to perceive the world slightly out of phase for 1 round. During this time, they lose any positive Dex modifier, have Disadvantage on all attacks, and have a 50% chance of having any spells they cast fail.
		The temporal effect of the orb may be changed by casting at higher odd-level spell slots.
		The material component is a tanzanite shard that has spent one subjective day in the demiplane of time, which must simply be kept on the caster's person.
		At Higher Levels:
		Damage: Every spell slot level above 1st adds an additional 1d8 to the damage.
		Effect: A 1st level slot orb causes the victim to Wis save or be affected byTemporal Disjuction for 1 round (Victim loses any positive Dex modifier, has Disadvantage on all attacks, and has a 50% chance of having any spells they cast fail). A 3rd level slot orb causes the victim to Wis save or be Slowed for 1d4 rounds (As per standard spell). A 5th level slot orb causes the victim to Wis save or be affected by Time Loop for 1d4 + 1 rounds (Victim must repeat the action taken this round, or attempt to repeat it, no matter what). A 7th level slot orb causes the victim to Wis save or become Temporal Pushed (Victim is thrown forward in time 1 round plus up to 1 round per caster level - chosen by caster). A 9th level slot orb causes the victim to Wis save or become trapped in Temporal Stasis indefinitely (Victim is suspended in time and cannot move, act, age, nor die).

		By means of a Timeslip, the barrier between reality and the demiplane of time is thinned, and the caster instantly slips between the two. Any creatures intending to attack someone who manages to Timeslip away beforehand lose their attacks for that round.
		Slipping into the demiplane of time places the caster and his companions immediately downstream of their lifelines (add one round to the casting time for each companion). Lifelines trail off into the silver mist that surrounds them. If there is heavy turbulence in the area, the travelers are displaced slightly so that they are relatively safe.
		When casting Timeslip from within the demiplane of time in order to slip back into reality, the caster must focus on a lifeline to make the connection with reality. The caster ends up somewhere within 1d10 miles of the creature whom the lifeline corresponds to. This feature also helps a caster who wishes to intersect their fate with that of the owner of a specific lifeline.
		All that the caster (and any additional target) is wearing or carrying slips with them, up to a maximum of 25 pounds per level. Unwilling targets make a Wisdom save to negate the entire spell and cancel the slip.
		The material components for this spell are a diaphanous square of fine silk and a small piece of basalt

	<components>V, S, M A tiny ornate hourglass worth 50 gp, destroyed</components>
	<description>
		The caster affixes a single target object of Small size or smaller in time for the duration of the spell. Momentum, thermal energy, electrical potential, etc are all preserved as well. The item cannot be moved or otherwise interacted with. It behaves as though an indestructible, immovable rod. At the time of casting, the caster determines a trigger that will end the spell early. It can be simple something like a password or gesture, or it could be as complex as a specific person attempting to interact with the object at just the right time in history (think Excalibur in the stone). It can be used to secure one's belongings for a duration, like a temporal lock box, or to set up a parameter trap to guard a sleeping camp, to preserve some perishable or other package until just the right recipient comes to claim it, etc. Arrows in flight, bombs mid-explosion, or other such items can be frozen with this spell such that their destructive energy is released upon trigger, making an effective trap. The trigger can be set to activate out to a distance of 15 feet from the object. A successful Dispel Magic, or similar spell, cast by a spellcaster of higher level than the caster was at time of casting can also terminate the effect.
		The material component necessary is a tiny ornate hourglass worth at least 50 gp, which must be irrecoverably smashed at the time of casting.
		At Higher Levels:
		For every 2 spell slot levels higher than normal used to cast this spell, the maximum size of the object affected is increased by one size category, up to a maximum of Huge, while simultaneously, every 3 levels of spell slot used to cast above normal increases the time units of duration by one category.
		2nd level spell slot - Maximum target size of Small, for 1 day per caster level
		4th level spell slot - Maximum target size of Medium, for 1 day per caster level
		5th level spell slot - Maximum target size of Medium, for 1 week per caster level
		6th level spell slot - Maximum target size of Large, for 1 week per caster level
		8th level spell slot - Maximum target size of Huge, for 1 month per caster level
		Additionally, spell slot levels may be increased to extend the duration. For every level increase that isn't used for increasing target size category, duration units of time go up one category:
		+1 spell slot level - Days to Weeks, Weeks to Months, Months to Years, and finally to a maximum of Years to Decades.
		This scaling may be used in conjunction with the size scaling, but each portion of the spell slot's level will only apply to one or the other. For example, a 6th level spell slot may either be used to affect a Large object for 1 week per caster level (2 levels to cast the spell, 4 levels applied to size only), to affect a Medium object for 1 month per caster level (2 levels to cast the spell, 3 levels applied to size, 1 to duration), or to affect a Small object for 1 decade per caster level (2 levels to cast the spell, 4 levels applied to duration only), etc

		When Lifeline Ping is cast, the caster establishes a temporary link to the subject's lifeline. A magical pulse is sent along the line in both directions, reflecting back whenever it reaches the points of the recipient's birth and death. Using the echo principle, the caster acquires a general idea of the length of the lifeline in each direction. If the subject's age is known or can be guessed, it is then a simple matter of calculating the ratios to discover with fair accuracy how much life the person has left.
		After 6th level, the caster acquires an innate feeling for the spell's mystical echo and can instantly know the subject's age, as well as how much life it has left, without having to make any calculations.
		Note that creatures who have traveled through time have incontinuous lifelines as a result of their travels, and this spell will only yield the length of time that creature existed in reality after returning from their last trip through time, and before next departing through time again in the future.
		A saving throw is not permitted, but physical contact must be maintained throughout the casting. The subject would have to either be a willing participant, or be unable to struggle away.
		The material component necessary for a Life Sounding is an unblemished silver weight on a 1-foot length of silver chain. The weight must be replaced with a fresh silver weight after every casting.

		You slightly inhibit the flow of time around up to six target creatures in a 40-foot cube. Each of these targets must succeed on a Wisdom save or be affected by the spell.
		Each affected target has their movement speed reduced by half, -2 to AC and to Dexterity saves, and cannot use any Reactions. During each victim's turn, they must choose between using an action or a bonus action, instead of using both. Affected victims can also only use a single melee or ranged attack each round, while the spells is in effect.
		Affected spellcasters who attempt to cast a spell with casting time of 1 action must roll a d20. If the result is an 11 or higher, the spell completion (and effect) is delayed until the caster's next turn, and ANOTHER action must be spent on that turn in order to complete the spell. If an action cannot be used in this way, or all actions are spent performing other actions on that following turn, then the spell is wasted.
		Affected victims are allowed an additional Wisdom save at the end of each turn. If successful, they break free of the effect, though the spell continues to effect all other victims.
		This spell is similar to the common 3rd level wizard spell, Slow, except that it differs in the exact implementation of the effect, and is available to the practitioners of Chronomancy as a 2nd level spell, due to the caster's advanced grasp of time manipulation

		Alacritic Casting allows you to speed up the casting time of your spells of 5th level and lower. Only spells that are cast within Alacritic Casting's duration are affected. The end result of this is that you may use 2 Reactions total per turn so long as both Reactions are used only to cast Reaction-time spells of an effected level. You gain one additional Bonus Action per turn which may only be used to cast a Bonus-time spell of an effected level. You also gain one additional Action per turn which may only be used to cast a spell of an effected level. Finally, the casting times for effected-level spells, whose normal casting times are longer than 1 Action, are reduced by 20%.
		Effect on Caster Per Round:
		Normal amount of actions, and
		+1 Bonus Action for a Bonus Action spell
		+1 Reaction for a Reaction spell
		+1 Reaction for a Reaction spell
		+1 Action for any spell
		Spells with casting time > 1 Action are reduced by 20% of original casting time
		The material component is a miniature hourglass which is destroyed when the spell is cast.
		At Higher Levels:
		For every 2 additional levels of spell slot expended to cast this spell, spells of 1 level higher will be effected. So, a 4th level slot will effect 6th level and lower spells; a 6th level slot will effect 7th level and lower spells; and an 8th level slot will effect 8th level and lower spells.

	<description>
		Age Plant:
		When this spell is cast, it manipulates time to accelerate the aging of plants. This does not allow them to grow beyond their maximum natural size. The area of effect is up to a maximum of 100 square feet per caster's level, and the spell can affect all plant life or be limited to affect only one category (eg. 'trees') or one species (eg. 'wheat') of plant in that area. The caster can accelerate the growth of plant life by up to one month per level. The actual amount of aging (to the nearst week) must be decided before the spell is cast. Aging occurs at a rate of 1 month of aging every 10 minutes of time passed. If the normal cycle of the plant is exceeded (for a seasonal crop or biannual flower), the plant life withers and dies. This spell is particularly useful when early winters or harsh summers threaten crop yields.
		A material component is necessary only if the caster wishes to affect a single category or species of plant. A sample of that plant type is then required.
		Rewind Plant:
		The reverse of this spell, Rewind Plant, cannot bring back plants that have completely died. It can reverse the aging of live plants by up to one month per level of the caster, the total age rewound being set before the spell is cast. Reverse aging occurs at a rate of 1 month of de-aging every 20 minutes of time passed. A popular use of this form is to get second harvests, but this can only be done with plants that persist year round (fruit trees, berry bushes).
		The same rules on material components apply.

		Age Object:
		As the caster focuses on the object or area, they determine a volume in cubic inches they wish to affect. Every second they concentrate, the non-living material inside the volume either ages or moves through time at a rate of (caster level x 1000) / (2 x cubic volume) days per second. An example here would be an 8-cubic-inch padlock aged by a level 3 caster for a full 5 minutes would advance a maximum of ~150 years. A level 20 caster doing the same would advance it ~1000 years. A level 20 caster attempting to age a child-sized statue (2500 cubic inches) for 5 minutes would age it 800 days.
		NOTE: The minimum dimension that can be used in this calculation is 1/2 an inch, so a 8.5 x 11 inch piece of paper, for example, which normally has a thickness of 0.004 inches, can at the very least be calculated as 8.5 x 11 x 0.5 inches, yielding 46.75 cubic inches, NOT 8.5 x 11 x 0.004 inches, which would have yielded 0.374 cubic inches.
		Rewind Object:
		Attempting to reverse the age of the item instead yields half the results. This spell only works on non-living material, as time potential is much greater (and thus harder to alter) where living beings are involved (even more so as their agency or potential for influence increases).
		Casting Modes:
		There are two 'modes', or mind-frames, in which this spell may be cast. It is simplest to think about this difference in the following way: cast the spell targeting a volume of MATTER, or cast the spell targeting a volume of SPACE.
		In the former case, the subjective and causal passage of time from the matter's perspective is altered. Time begins to accelerate, causing the reactions, wear and tear, loss or expenditure, and increase of entropy to affect the matter itself. Metal could rust, and crumble. Bread could mold, flowers wither, silver tarnish, a lit log burn to charcoal, etc. In the reverse form, the spell causes the subjective flow of time to be reversed, rust or broken metal reforming and renewing, moldy food returning to freshness, dead flowers returning, etc. This is the only 'safe' form in which this spell can be cast (base 0% chance of a disturbance to the demiplane of time, no chance of paradox), and this is the only functionality this spell can ever have if cast by any magic user other than a Chronomancer (who do not understand the far more advanced details of space and time's codependent relationship).
		In the latter case, a fixed volume of space is focused upon and -like the window on a slide-rule- is temporally slid forward or backward through time. This region of space can be anything the Chronomancer decides; the space bounded by a wine bottle, or by a window frame, or immediately surrounding a page of paper, for example. The contents within the volume of space change to reflect what WAS/WILL BE inside that space at the point in time the spell moves the slider to. Words on a page that are most likely to be written may appear if sliding forward; or if already written, will disappear if rolled far enough back. A seemingly-'empty' region of space, such as a shattered window-frame, may suddenly fill with intact glass if rolled back to a point when they were undamaged; or if rolled forward, a perfectly fine window may shatter because a rock will be thrown through it in the future (or, may stay completely intact, just gaining some grime, if nothing ever goes on to break the window in the future...)
		Higher Level Slots:
		For each level of spell slot expended above level 2, add another effective caster level when calculating effect, and increase chance of temporal disturbance to the demiplane of time by 5%.

		In reaction to the sudden demise of an ally in sight, to the caster receiving lethal damage, or to the destruction or loss of some highly valued object, the caster immediately winds time back a single round inside a space no larger than a 10 foot cube containing the fateful subject, allowing the caster or his allies to correct a single fatal mistake. The reason this spell can reverse a death, while other time spells such as Timeheal cannot, is because this spell is necessarily used in the moments of death, while the lifeline of the dying individual has not yet terminated; their life force has not fully departed.
		Use of this spell causes turbulence in the demiplane of time and has a 10% chance of attracting attention from its inhabitants.
		The material component of this spell is a zircon gem.
		This spell is an original work.

		Upon casting this spell, the caster creates a time loop in the creature's mind that causes it to repeat this round's action indefinitely. If the creature attacked, it attacks the same person again. If it drank a potion, it drinks from the same bottle again. Even if something happens to prevent this attempt (eg. the opponent is dead, or someone takes the bottle away), the subject still strives to repeat its last action.
		The victim gains a Wisdom save at the end of every round it is affected by the spell, until the loop is broken. Starting with the second saving throw, the creature gains a cumulative +1 bonus to this save every round.
		Based on the 2e ADnD spell Time Snare, from the Chronomancer suppliment (TSR 9506).

		You steal the next 6 seconds of a target's future.
		Select a living creature you can see within 60'.  They lose all actions on their next turn, but are still able to take their movement.  Draining your victim of time itself, you find that you are somehow able to take an additional 1 Action, 1 Reaction, and 1 Bonus Action this turn.  A victim may only be drained of their immediate future with this spell once per round.
		This process is strenuous.  Each time you cast this spell, make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, or gain 1 level of exhaustion.
		Casting this spell on a non-linear creature (for example, a native of the Demiplane of Time) has an unusual effect.  Instead of causing them to lose their actions, you deal 2d8 + 1/level Force damage to them.  You still gain the additional 1 Action, 1 Reaction, and 1 Bonus Action this turn.
		At Higher Levels:
		For each level of spell slot above 3rd, you may target 1 additional creature.  You also gain an additional Action, Reaction, and Bonus Action this turn for each target.
		This spell is an original work.

		By use of this spell, the caster manipulates time so that the recipient gains more use out of a single combat round. The creature does not move faster, but rather accellerates their ability to perceive and react.  This extra awareness and control grants multiple bonuses. Such an effected creature has previously been described as performing the most graceful and fluid of deadly dances, as every single movement is perfectly utilized to its fullest combat potential.
		The target gains 1 extra melee attack for every 5 caster levels (up to four total attacks). Also, a +1 bonus is applied to the target's Initiative and AC, and enemies get Disadvantage against being surprised by the target, due to the extra attention that they can pay to fine details. This spell is not cumulative with itself or any other spell granting extra attacks. Also, it does not allow for casting of extra spells per round, or the extra use of magical items.
		The material component required is a drop of mercury.
		Based on 2e ADnD spell Melee Manager, from the Chronomancer suppliment (TSR 9506).

		When this spell is cast on a creature of Intelligence 2 or greater, it fastens a magical tether to the creature's lifeline. The creature must be close enough for the caster to recognize it by sight, and it can attempt a Wisdom save to avoid the effect. This sets the range at 60 yards for typical conditions. Items such as Eyes of the Eagle would extend this range, but psionic powers like Clairvoyance or any type of scrying would not.
		If the caster slips to the demiplane of time, he appears next to the affected creature's lifeline. The tether is seen as a thin white cord linking it and the caster. As with Timeslip, a large amount of turbulence may displace the caster, but they remain tethered to that lifeline. If Lifeline Tether is cast directly on a lifeline, no save is permitted. Slipping back to reality places the caster within 1d100 x 10 yards of the creature.
		Casting Detect Temporal Anomaly always leads the caster right to the tethered creature. This application is useful for finding out who a particular lifeline belongs to.
		The material component is a 1-foot length of cord braided with strands of silver.

		By use of an Extension spell, the caster prolongs the duration of a single previously cast 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell by 50%. Thus, a Levitation spell can be made to function up to 15 minutes (rather than 10), a Hold Person spell made to work for up to 90 seconds (rather than 60), etc. Naturally, the spell affects only spells that have a duration. This spell must be cast immediately after the target spell which the caster wishes to extend, either by the original caster (extend one's own spells) or another spellcaster (extend someone else's spell). If one full round or more elapses between the target spell's casting and the casting of Extension, it cannot be extended, and this spell fails, and its slot wasted.
		At Higher Levels:
		4th level slot - This spell is the same as the 3rd-level slot Extension spell, except it extends the duration of 1st-through 4th-level spells by 50%.
		5th level slot - This spell is the same as the 3rd-level slot Extension spell, except that it will extend the duration of 1st- through 3rd-level spells by 100%, and will extend the duration of 4th- and 5th-level spells by 50%.
		Inspired by the 2e ADnD Wizard spells Extension I, Extension II, and Extension III.

		When this spell is cast, the caster may take back an action performed sometime within the last 2 rounds per caster level, or insert an additional action if timing permits. The caster could take back something said, or decide not to kiss the king's daughter. They could NOT insert another attack into a combat round (unless an attack was intentionally skipped during the target round), but COULD insert an attack into the round BEFORE combat.
		If an action is taken back that would've prevented combat (insulting the goblin king) or another major event, the caster and DM will need to work out a reasonable course of events that would make up for that lost time.
		Turbulence created by this spell has a 1% per round affected chance of attracting a Time Demielemental or Chronomancer guardian from the demiplane of time.

		This spell takes the creature it was cast upon and rolls back its body to an earlier point in time. If it was in better health in the past, this simulates a healing ability without using clerical powers. Time is of the essence when using this spell, though, as the farther into the past the body is to be pushed, the greater the chance of failure.
		The caster is able to unerringly push the body back one minute in time for every caster level. For example, a 9th-level caster is guaranteed to restore a person to the state of health its body was in up to nine minutes ago. For every additional minute that the caster attempts to push the body backward in time, there is a cumulative 5% chance of failure. If the 9th-level caster tried to use this spell to heal a warrior wounded just under 20 minutes before the spell was cast, that would be 11 minutes further than he could guarantee success, so the spell would have a 55% chance of failing.
		Multiple Timeheals cannot be cast to increase number of minutes that the caster can guarantee pushing the body backward in time. The 9th-level wizard cannot cast three consecutive Timeheals to roll the patient back 27 minutes in time. This is because the caster is actually bringing the patient's past body into the present with each casting. Each time, that example spell goes back only nine minutes, and it brings back the same nine-minute-old version of the body.
		Timeheal cannot recall a spirit from death (unless DM rules it has not yet departed, within a single round, within the last few seconds, for example) and therefore is only useful on a still-living character. A dead body that has Timeheal cast on it may be entirely healed of damage, but it remains dead, as the body's spirit has fled. If the spirit can somehow be reunited with the body, though (say through Raise Dead, or a ghost possessing its own body), the patient will then be alive and as well as the Timeheal can make him.
		Timeheal can also be used to hurt an opponent that has recently healed itself. In this case, the caster must successfully touch the target (with an attack roll), and the target gets a Wisdom save. Any healing (or damage) done to the target since the moment that the body is being rolled back to is negated, but all the damage the body had at that point is immediately reapplied. The resources used to heal the target are entirely wasted. The standard chances of failure based on time and level still apply.

		Upon casting Temporal Push, the caster opens a partially-formed slipgate to the demiplane of time and attempts to force a creature through it. Because this slipgate is not fully formed, the subject automatically slips back to reality at a later time. The creature is thrown forward up to 1 round + 1 round per caster level. The amount must be decided when the spell is cast. The spell removes the creature from reality for a limited time, allowing the caster to deal with other problems or prepare a 'welcome' for the returning creature. The affected creature is aware of no passage of time. Everything seems to suddenly blip or shift about, as if they instantaneously teleported forward in time. If a physical presence is occupying the space to be returned to, the creature is displaced slightly on return. At the time of the casting, both the caster and target make separate Wisdom checks; first the caster, then the target. For every point by which the caster succeeds their own check, assign a -1 penalty to the target's roll (up to a max of -4). If the caster fails the check, or if the target succeeds (after penalties), then it is the caster who ends up getting pushed through the slipgate instead.

		Duration: 1d10 + 5 days
		When this spell is cast, the affected creature loses all sense of time. It is perpetually late, unable to function under any time restraints. This spell is merely an annoyance unless accurate timing is crucial. Creatures afflicted by this spell automatically lose initiative and are always surprised if attacked from stealth. In combat, creatures with multiple Actions automatically lose one Action, and Bonus Actions and Reactions cannot be used. A Wisdom save negates the spell.
		Against another spellcaster, or a creature of the demiplane of time, this spell is particularly effective. Any spellcaster under the effects of the Temporal Disjunction who attempts to cast a time-affecting spell automatically fails. Any native creature of the demiplane of time also loses any time-related abilities, and suffers 2d6 + 1 point per caster level points of damage. In both cases, any ability (natural or spell effect) to slip between reality and the demiplane of time is lost. Chronomancers and creatures native to the demiplane of time gain a +1 to their Wisdom save against this spell.
		The Time Dimielemental is the hardest hit by the Temporal Disjunction: In addition to the above penalties, it also loses its ability to slip in more copies of itself.

		When this spell is cast, the caster enters a trance and, through visions of the future, attempts to divine an important event that shall come to pass. The event must directly affect the person touched, and this person cannot be the caster. The vision fades out and returns several times over the spell's duration, and much of it is vague and open to interpretation. A caster cannot cast this spell more than once to prophecize the same event--at least not until the character reaches their next level.
		At 10th level, the caster may attempt to divine a prophecy concerning an event affecting a location on the grand scale of a town or kingdom. There is a low probability that this succeeds (only 1% per caster level), but the attempt can be made once per day.
		This spell leaves the caster physically drained and unable to move for 1d4 hours.
		The material component for the first version is the root of a plant with hallucinatory properties. For the second version, a gem worth 5,000 gp must be buried near the center of the location.
		Based on the 2e ADnD spell Prophecy, from the Chronomancer suppliment (TSR 9506).

		Quick Description:
		On casting...
		- Pick a target creature within 60' (or self) : There are now two of the target creature, for the next minute.
		- Roll percentile : base 30% chance that hostile creatures from the demiplane of time are summoned.
		- Roll percentile : base 10% chance of Temporal Storm for each powerful/historically pivotal item duplicated.
		On spell end...
		- Flip a coin to pick a copy : that copy and all gear they appeared with vanishes.  Now only spells/charges/abilities the remaining copy used count as spent.
		- Target makes Wisdom save vs base DC 15, or suffers Disadvantage on all rolls for 1d6 days.
		Full Description:
		There are now two of the target creature, for the next minute...  This dangerous spell causes a single target creature in range that the caster can see to begin to exist in two mutually exclusive states of probability, causing the target's lifeline to fork temporarily.  For the next minute, that creature exists in two places at once, each instance of it acting according to their own subjective perspective and circumstance, until reality is able to correct the anomaly.  Each instance of the target creature has all of their non-magical (see At Higher Levels for magic items effected with higher level slots) equipment and items, their unspent spell slots, and unused abilities.  Any magical items that were not bifurcated are evenly divided between the two creature instances as their controller sees fit, but must be decided upon immediately as the spell is cast.  Each instance of the target creature may use any or all of their independent resources, without effecting the quantity of the other instance.  Keep track of consumables, charges, spells, and abilities used separately for each instance of the target creature.  This is essentially like having a twin of the target creature for the duration of the spell, as well as a second piece of every affected item they were carrying when the spell was cast.
		Control:
		Both instances of the target creature share all initiatives, and are both controlled by the original character's owner (DM if NPC, Player if PC, etc), though the group may decide to allow two people to separately control each instance, with the owner's explicit permission, if it would simplify things or enhance fun.
		Spell End:
		One random copy, and all gear they started with vanishes; the other remains.  Only spells/charges/abilities the remaining copy used were spent...  At the end of this spell's duration, one of the two instances is chosen at random.  The selected instance and all their original bifurcated gear (regardless of who currently holds it) vanishes, and only the other instance now remains.  Only item charges, spells, abilities, consumables, damage, healing, status effects, afflictions, etc that the remaining creature has used or is suffering now apply.  (It may be helpful to refer to the copies as 'Heads' and 'Tails', 'Evens' and 'Odds', 'High' and 'Low', etc as soon as the spell is cast, to help track which copy vanishes when the spell ends.)
		This spell ends prematurely if either of the creature instances is slain, destroyed, petrified, imprisoned (via the spell Imprisonment), or afflicted by any other similar character-ending effect.  If this happens, immediately select one of the two creature instances at random, as you normally would.  If the afflicted instance ends up being the one that remains, the creature is now suffering the affliction.
		This spell also ends immediately if anyone casts Lifeline Bifurcation on a creature already affected by this spell.
		Any non-bifurcated items that the vanished instance might have picked up or been given during the duration of the spell are left on the ground where they vanished.  Any duplicated items dropped or given to another character by the vanished instance before the spell ended vanish along with the creature.
		Risks:
		A base 30% chance that hostile creatures from the demiplane of time are summoned...  Casting this spell is a severe violation of the natural order of temporal mechanics, and essentially creates a short-lived, but very real paradox.  Much of the magic power of this spell is, in fact, spent simply containing this paradox so that it doesn't damage reality.  Large amounts of turbulence are created in the time-stream of the demiplane of time.  There is a 30% chance that this attracts the attention of some inhabitants of that demiplane.
		A Base 10% chance of Temporal Storm for each powerful item duplicated...  Additionally, powerful or important items that get bifurcated by this spell carry a risk of inflating this paradoxical event to the point that it exceeds the spell's constraints and damages the fabric of reality.  The DM decides what items are famous, historically influential, or powerful enough to be considered 'troublesome' should two instances of them exist simultaneously.  For each 'troublesome' item bifurcated in this way, there is a cumulative 10% chance that a hole is torn in reality.  If this should happen, a massive Temporal Storm of tornadoes and mist-smoke will form, immediately pulling the caster, the target creature, and any living creatures within 100 feet of them out of reality, leaving them stranded in the demiplane of time.  Artifacts (allowed at higher level castings) are automatically considered 'troublesome', unless the DM rules otherwise (such as might be the case for certain Chronomancer Artifacts).  Roll this probability as the spell is cast.
		A Wisdom save vs base DC 15, or suffers Disadvantage on all rolls for 1d6 days...  Finally, when this spell ends, the target must make a Wisdom save to avoid long term scarring to their lifeline.  On a failed save, the target's fate is damaged, and as a result, they suffer Disadvantage on all rolls they make for the next 1d6 days.  This rotten run of luck due to damaged fate can be repaired at any time by spending all charges of the Lucky feat, by having Greater Restoration, Wish, or a similar restorative or reality-altering spell cast, or by spending an Inspiration token.  Otherwise, the damage mends itself naturally after the 1d6 days have elapsed.  Note: any character may spend their Lucky charges or use their Inspiration to heal another character's damaged fate.  The base DC for this save is 15.
		The spell component is a tiny silver pitcher with two spouts.
		At Higher Levels:
		5th level slot - Common magic items on target are now also bifurcated.  Save at end of spell is DC 14.  Chance of Temporal Storm is 8% per troublesome item.
		6th level slot - Uncommon magic items on target are now also bifurcated.  Save at end of spell is DC 13.  Chance of Temporal Storm is 6% per troublesome item.
		7th level slot - Rare magic items on target are now also bifurcated.  Save at end of spell is DC 12.  Chance of Temporal Storm is 4% per troublesome item.
		8th level slot - Legendary magic items on target are now also bifurcated.  Save at end of spell is DC 11.  Chance of Temporal Storm is 2% per troublesome item.
		9th level slot - Artifacts on target are now also bifurcated.  Save at end of spell is DC 10.  Chance of Temporal Storm is 1% per troublesome item.

		By casting this spell, the caster causes all ferrous metals (iron, iron alloys such as steel, etc) within the spell's AoE to be held fast, similar to the way a person would be held by a Hold Person spell.  Swords being swung, pendulum blades arcing, and other metallic objects stop mid-motion.  Although these metal objects can be touched, they cannot be moved for the duration of the spell, as if the metal weighed tons or was held fast by Sovereign Glue.  This spell is often used to prevent individuals from drawing weapons or from removing metallic or partially metallic objects from the affected area.  The spell is especially useful against individuals clad in chain or plate armor.  Beings wearing any ferrous armor find that while under the effects of this spell they cannot move - caged by their own apparel.  Furthermore, anyone wearing metal or carrying metal items who enters the AoE of an in-effect Hold Metal spell finds that such metal is instantly rendered immobile - from weapons to metal buttons, buckles, cloak clasps, etc.
		Nonferrous metals are unaffected by Hold Metal, so an individual wearing bronze plate or picking up a pure silver candelabrum is able to proceed unhindered if the item in question does not have iron or other ferrous metals hidden within it (items such as a plating of nonferrous metal over steel or iron WOULD be effected).  Note that most nonferrous metals are not sturdy enough for use in heavy tools without at least some amount of ferrous metal alloyed within them.
		DM discretion as to what items contain affected metals.
		The material component for this spell is a lodestone, magnet, or piece of iron, which had previously been kept on the demiplane of time for 24 subjective hours.

		Temporal Wall creates a thin barrier composed of the mist-smoke of the demiplane of time. The wall cannot be moved once created, but it can be shaped in any way (circles, domes, and so on) and placed anywhere within the spell's range. Anyone trying to pass through this wall in either direction suffers the effects of two cumulative Slow spells and a Temporal Disjunction (Creatures afflicted automatically lose initiative, and are automatically surprised if attacked from stealth. Creatures with multiple Actions automatically lose one Action, all Bonus Actions and all Reactions. Natives to the demiplane of time take 2d6 + 1 per caster level damage). Creatures can make saves against each Slow to avoid their effects, but not against the Temporal Disjunction. Missiles, breath weapons, and spell effects are also slowed by the wall, allowing victims a Dexterity save for half damage. Dispel Magic cannot destroy the wall, but any sort of magical items which destroy magic can affect this spell. Pass Wall, Dimension Door, Teleport, and other travelling spells can be used to bypass or destroy the wall.
		The material component is a strand of webbing from a Timeweaver Spider's web.

		Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round / level, or Permanent*
		When this spell is cast, the evolutionary clock of the target is reversed, and its fighting ability is increased at the cost of its mind. The target gains 1d6 in each of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution (maximums of 22), while losing 3d6 in each of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma (minimums of 2). Nails and teeth become sharper and usable as weapons. There is a marked increase in body hair, and other body changes might be notices (longer arms, hunched posture, thicker bones, pronounced brow, etc). At any Intelligence below 5, the creature automatically shuns weapons in favor of a claw/claw/bite attack (1d6/1d6/1d8; if a creature already had these attacks, increase the size of each damage die by one). The creature must roll a Death Save until it either fails twice, or succeeds once. If it fails twice, this change is permanent. Unwilling targets may attempt a Constitution save to negate the spell.
		For an unknown reason, Devolutionary Warrior does not have any effect on Elves. Some Chronomancers hypothesize that perhaps elves were created whole by the gods, without evolution, rather than simply having an innate resistance.  Others suppose the inherrent magic of Elves somehow interferes with this particular spell.
		Half-Elves are weakly affected, and gain only 1d3 in each of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, and lose only 2d6 in each of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
		The material component for this spell is the tooth of a gorilla or carnivorous ape.

		Area of Effect: A surface area of 20 square feet
		Upon casting this spell, the caster twists the momentum of time to create a permanent gate between reality and the demiplane of time. The gateway is totally flat (2-dimensional), but can be in any contiguous shape the caster desires, up to 20 square feet in area. Care must be exercised, since denizens of the timestreams are attracted to this portal and may be lying in wait on the demiplane of time, or possibly even attempt to come through into reality. Timegates are a liability as much as a convenience.
		The material component for this spell is a diamond worth 5,000 gp that has been on the demiplane of time for at least one subjective day.
		The caster must make a Wisdom save once the spell has been cast. Failure means the gateway collapses. Whatever the result, the diamond is consumed and lost in the process.

		Duration: Determined by caster: up to 10 minutes / level, or up to 20 minutes / level if reversed
		Age Animal:
		Upon casting this spell, the caster manipulates time in respect to a creature of animal Intelligence or lower. A creature ages up to one month per caster level. The amount of aging must be decided before the spell is cast. Aging occurs at a rate of one month of aging per 10 minutes of time passed. The creature must make Death Saves until either a single success, or two failures occurs. It gains +1 to this roll for every 5 Hit Dice it has. If it fails the save twice, it dies of shock in 1d4 rounds. Any actions (combat, flight, and so on) the creature takes during the process occur at half its normal ability (attacks as if at half its Hit Dice and loses half its attacks, base speed is halved, and so on). This spell does not allow the creature to exceed its maximum natural size.
		The material component necessary for this spell is a piece of bio-matter from the type of animal to be affected. If the Chronomancer touches the animal during the spell, no material component is required.
		Rewind Animal:
		The reverse, Rewind Animal, reduces the age of the affected creature by up to one month per caster's level, to a minimum age of one month. The amount of change must be decided before the spell is cast, and the reversal occurs at a rate of one month of de-aging every 20 minutes of time passed.
		The rules for material component are the same.
		Based on 2e ADnD spell Accellerate Animal Growth, from the Chronomancer suppliment (TSR 9506).

		This spell delays the time normally spent each round recovering from the effects of spellcasting. This allows for more spellcastings per round, but 2 rounds of rest are required after the Optimized Casting's duration ends, during which the caster can perform no casting or combat actions (drinking potions and moving are allowed). While this spell is in effect, all spells with a casting time of less than a minute are treated as having a casting time of 1 Bonus Action instead.
		Starting the round after this spell is cast, the caster gains an additional 2 Bonus Actions each round that may only be used to cast spells.
		Any round in which the caster uses this effect, they may not take any non-casting actions. Any round in which the caster takes a non-casting action is considered a normal round, and this spell continues to remain in effect until the duration expires.
		Only spells of 4th level or lower whose casting time is less than 1 minute may be cast at all while using the effects of the Optimized Casting and no single spell can be cast more than once in the same round, so long as Optimized Casting is still in effect. Doing so ends the Optimized Casting spell immediately.
		Effect Per Round:
		Normal number of actions available, and
		+1 Bonus Action to cast a spell,
		+1 Bonus Action to cast a spell,
		All spells with casting time less than 1 minute are now casting time Bonus Action,
		Each spell may only be cast once each round (violation ends this spell),
		No non-spell actions may be taken if extra spells are cast this round (cannot be violated)
		The material components are a hummingbird's tongue and some poppy seeds.
		Inspired by the 2e ADnD spell Magic Manager, from the Chronomancer suppliment (TSR 9506).

		When Create Paradox is cast, the caster may alter a minor event from their past, which may affect the present. Such an event could be exchanging one memorized spell for a more useful one, having brought a cask of ale instead of a cask of oil, or deciding that, instead of insulting the orcs' chieftain (who has been harboring a grudge, and now the characters need his help), the heroes insulted their finest warrior. The event to be changed should not be more than 3 hours long in duration, and it must be something that was personally done by the caster, or something the caster could have directly influenced. (Perhaps the party's Rogue actually made the insult, and the caster uses Create Paradox to explain it away at the expense of the orc warrior.) Something should always be given up in trade for whatever is gained when this spell is used. The caster can change an event as far back as 1 month per caster level into the past. It is the DM's call as to how that change propagates forward, if at all. Often, things will not work out as neatly as the caster might hope. The orc chieftain could still bear a grudge (that the warrior was insulted), or the warrior might wish now for personal satisfaction.
		Turbulence created by casting Create Paradox has a 5% per month affected chance of attracting a Time Demielemental or Chronomancer guardian from the demiplane of time.
		Based on the 2e ADnD spell Paradox, from the Chronomancer suppliment (TSR 9506).

		The caster splits the flow of time around a temporal disturbance. This reduces the turbulence it causes and shields it against the efforts of magical detection. A Detect Temporal Anomaly (or an item or ability with the same effect) retains any normal bonus chance of detecting the hidden effect, but its base chance is now lowered to 25%. Other detection spells (True Seeing, Detect Invisibility, etc) also have a 25% chance to detect the anomaly, but those uninitiated in the mysteries of Chronomancy are unlikely to know just what it is they are seeing.
		Temporal vortices on the demiplane of time can be hidden in this way, but the forces involved become extremely hazardous. The caster must make a Wisdom ability check with a -4 penalty. Failure destroys the vortex, ages the caster 1d20 years, and reduces the caster's Wisdom permanently by 1 point.  The destruction of a vortex will also create significant amounts of turbulence downstream in the timeline on the demiplane of time, which may attract all manor of unwanted attention from its inhabitants.
		The material component is a glass bulb filled with the blood of a Timeweaver Spider. This spell cannot be used cumulatively with itself.
		Based on the 2e ADnD spell of the same name, from the Chronomancer suppliment (TSR 9506).

		This spell allows the caster to scry people or places in other times. This operates within the caster's mind, and any innate abilities or permanent spell effects placed on the caster apply. Spells like Comprehend Languages, Read Magic, and Darkvision work through Temporal Eye. Spells like Tongues, Detect Magic, Detect Good/Evil, and Message have a 5% chance per caster level of working correctly through the Temporal Eye. Spells such as Locate Object, Domination, Suggestion, and True Seeing have a 5% chance per 2 caster levels of working correctly through the Temporal Eye. The chance for scrying success, as well as the chance for detection, are the same as those for the Scrying spell. Scrying into a different time offers no further penalty. In any case, a spell or effect capable of detecting scrying attempts will detect a Temporal Eye, but does not necessarily reveal its anachronistic nature.
		There are many material components required. The eye of a far-seeing creature (eagle, hawk, etc) is held in the left hand. Blood from a Time Dog is mixed with a concoction of alcohol, sodium, and strychnine. Finally, hundreds of Strands must be collected from the demiplane of time, enchanted, woven into a veil, and worn over the face. All items are consumed by the spell, except the veil, which may be reused.

		Self-Affecting Spells:
		This spell affixes the effects of certain other spells in time, affecting the duration and essentially making their effect permanent. The types of self-affecting spells upon which a Permanent Magic is known to be effect are as follows: Comprehend Languages, Detect Good/Evil, Detect Invisibility, Detect Magic, Darkvision, Protection from Cantrips, Protection from Good/Evil, Protection from Normal Missiles, Tongues, Unseen Servant, as well as any others the DM sees fit to allow.
		This spell is cast, taking about 1 minute to complete (10 minutes if cast as an unprepared ritual).  If another spell is active at time of completion, it may be targeted by the caster for making permanent with this spell.  If not, there is a brief window following the casting of this spell for the caster to cast another spell to be made permanent.  It is easiest for short-lived spells and long-casting time spells to pair with another spellcaster who can cast the target spell, so the casting times may be overlapped to allow for the effect to be active upon completion of Permanent Magic.
		Cost: The caster casts the desired spell and then follows it with the Permanent Magic spell. Each time the caster casts this spell to make a magic effect permanent on themselves, their Constitution is permanently lowered by 1 point. The caster cannot make permanent the above spells for other persons, only for themselves. This application of Permanent Magic can only be dispelled by a spellcaster of greater level than the caster was at the time Permanent Magic was cast.
		Creature-Affecting Spells:
		Permanent Magic may also be used to make certain magical effects on other creatures permanent.  Spells such as: Enlarge, Shrink, Fear, Invisibility, Protection spells, Prismatic Sphere, Stinking Cloud, and others as allowed by the DM can be made permanent on a target creature.
		Cost: Like with a self-affecting application, the caster may cast this spell with a 1 minute casting time (10 minutes if cast as an unprepared ritual).  Doing so will similarly drain 1 point of Constitution from the caster, as they use their own vitality to fuel the casting on the fly.  However, there is another way to cast this spell when targeting another creature.  If the target creature is willing (or mentally incapable of objecting), then the spell may be prepared and cast like it is on objects or locations (see below).  The caster may spend 1 week in preperation per spell level, and at least 10,000 gp in goods or coin are consumed.  Cantrips require 4 days and at least 5,000 gp.  This method may not be used by the caster on themselves, as the preparation work requires the caster to move and interact with magical energies that would spoil and invalidate the prep-work.
		Other-Affecting Spells:
		In addition to a self- and creature-affecting use, the Permanent Magic spell can be used to make the following object- and area-affecting spells permanent: Alarm, Audible Glamer, Dancing Lights, Distance Distortion, Enlarge, Gust of Wind, Invisibility, Magic Mouth, Prismatic Sphere, Solid Fog, Stinking Cloud, Teleport, Temporal Wall, Wall of Fire, Wall of Force, Web, again plus or minus any the DM sees fit to allow.
		For this final non-living application, the target spell and Permanent Magic may be cast simultaneously together by the caster alone, overlapping, but any spell or effect that causes casting failure during this process would cause both simultaneous spells to fail together.
		Cost: Casting Permanent Magic for this purpose does not consume Constitution, but still exacts a steep price.  High quality goods or gold in values of at least 10,000 gp per spell level of the target magic effect to be made permanent are required for the casting, and consumed by it.  Cantrip effects targeted by Permanent Magic require no less than 5,000 gp.  Additionally, while the casting time for this spell remains 1 minute, this application requires a significant amount of prep time.  1 week per target spell level must be spent in preparation before casting the spell.  Cantrips require at least 4 days of preparation.
		Magic Item Creation:
		The Permanent Magic spell has also been rumored to have been used in the fabrication of certain old, powerful magic items. As the effect is not being made permanent on the caster themselves in these cases, Permanent Magic does not result in a loss of Constitution for the caster.  The cost required for this much more complex and advanced application of weaving magics into the essence of objects is sure to wildly vary for each specific application.  DMs should decide required time, cost, resources, and components for each proposed magic item a player wishes to create.
		DM Notes:
		At the DM's option, any application of Permanent Magic might become unstable or fail after very long periods of activity, such as having been in effect for at 1,000 years or more. Unstable effects might operate intermittently, might produce strange or unexpected side effects, or might simply fail altogether. The DM may determine that certain spells cannot be made permanent with this spell, or that custom variants of specific spells must first be researched before Permanent Magic can be used on them by a player. In the latter case, researching the special variant of a spell costs as much time and money as independently researching the original spell itself would. If the DM has already determined that the application is not possible, this research, if attempted, automatically fails. The caster should never learn what is possible except by the success or failure of their research.
		A non-Chronomancy variant of this spell may have once existed, but it is currently believed to be lost lore.

		This spell creates a field of temporal flux about the caster. This field intercepts physical attacks, and shifts all or part of the effects of physically applied spells into the future, allowing the caster more time to prepare. The magnitude of the shift depends on the type of attack.
		If the incoming attack deals damage, half the damage is applied immediately, and the other half is put off for the duration of the spell. This delays the need for healing, but casters of this spell must be careful not to lose track of time since casting. After the first turn, the spell could expire at any moment, and all deferred damage is then applied at once. This could easily kill a caster low on health.
		Healing potions and spells are applied first to already received damage, then to deferred damage. If the attack produces a spell effect (Imprisonment and Energy Drain deal no physical damage, for example, but require a touch), then those spells' effects are delayed for half the remainder of Delayed Damage's duration. Any prevention action taken (someone casting Freedom before Imprisonment takes effect, for instance) negates the upcoming effect.
		This spell cannot be used in conjunction with any contingency spells (spells that intentionally delay or defer self-cast spells from taking effect). Any spell of this nature placed on the caster dispels Delayed Damage automatically.
		At Higher Levels:
		If a 9th level spell slot is used to cast this spell, all damage and spell effects are delayed until the end of the effect (instead of half damage taken immediately, and spell effects being delayed half the remaining duration).
		Based on the 2e ADnD spell Delay Damage, from the Chronomancer suppliment (TSR 9506).

		Temporal Stasis:
		Upon casting this spell, the caster places the target into a state of suspended animation. This cessation of time means that the creature does not grow older. Its body functions virtually cease. This state persists until the magic is removed by a Dispel Magic spell or reverse of this spell, Temporal Reinstatement, is uttered.
		The material component of a Temporal Stasis spell is a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust, with each crushed stone worth at least 100 gp.
		Temporal Reinstatement:
		The reverse, Temporal Reinstatement, requires only a single word, and no somatic or material components.

		This spell sends those in its area of effect backward or forward in time, up to 5 years per the caster's level. In effect, it encases those affected in a null-time bubble and pushes them into the demiplane of time. The bubble then moves along the timestream in the predetermined direction, reenters reality at the desired time, and releases the travelers. To the travelers, no time has passed. Things simply blink around them from one moment to a sudden future or past moment. This is the only known way a caster can cause others to travel extensively throughout time without actually accompanying them.
		This can cause a real problem for subjects that end up in another time with no way back. Of course, if they happen to cause enough trouble to the natural order in their new time, the guardians of the demiplane of time may show up and give them a free ride home. The person who sent them there is likely in for a visit then, too.
		If a caster casts the spell on themselves, this can be used as an easy way to travel through time quickly with little or no risk from the dangers of the demiplane of time. It is not a cheap ride, though.
		The material component is a ruby worth 10,000 gp or more, which must be crushed into dust.
		Based on the 2e ADnD spell Timereaver, from the Chronomancer suppliment (TSR 9506).

		This spell attempts to alter time around the salient abilities of a magical item. This attempt may be made only once per item, and there is a significant chance of permanently ruining the affected item forever. Use the table below to figure the chance for failure.
		Frequency is the number of times per day the item can be used, or the recharge time required between uses. When this feature is altered, uses per day are doubled, or the recharge time is halved. The recharge time of a pair of Wings of Flying goes from 1d12 hours to 1d6 hours, for example.
		Duration is how long the effect is operating. Altering this doubles the duration. Wings of Flying could now be used for 2 hours before they disappear, instead of 1 hour.
		The material component is an ounce of mercury.

		Duration: Determined by caster: up to 10 minutes / level, or up to 20 minutes / level if reversed
		Age Person:
		This spell speeds the aging process of any creature of Intelligence 2 or greater. The creature ages up to one year per level of the caster. The exact amount must be set to the nearest month before the spell is cast. Aging occurs at a rate of one month of aging every 50 seconds of time passed (1 year per 10 minutes). No Death Save is required. While undergoing the change, any action attempted is performed at one-half normal ability.
		The material component is a small piece of polished amber and an ounce of ichor from a Aeon Behir. The affected creature must be touched, and it receives a Wisdom save if unwilling.
		Rewind Person:
		The reverse of this spell, Rewind Person, cannot bring back the dead, but it can reduce the age of the recipient by up to one year per level of the caster. Age reduction occurs at a rate of 1 year of de-aging every 20 minutes of time passed, and a Death Save must be either passed once or failed twice. If the Death save is failed twice, the target dies from shock, even as its body continues to grow younger. The creature must still be touched, and it receives a Wisdom save if unwilling, to avoid the effect.
		Material components are the same as above, plus a cup of pure spring water subjected to the demiplane of time for one subjective day.
		Inspired by the 2e ADnD spell Accelerate Lifeline, from the Chronomancer suppliment (TSR 9506).

		By touching the forehead of a willing recipient, you channel temporal energy through yourself to temporarily intensify the connection between the recipient and their lifeline in the demiplane of time.  As a result, events that directly impact that lifeline in the immediate future can be 'felt' coming.  The recipient can no longer be surprised, and gains Advantage on all attack rolls, saves, and checks.  Disadvantage is imposed on any attack made against the recipient.
		The caster can only act as a conduit for one target at a time.  Any additional castings of this spell cancel the effects of previous castings.
		The material component for this spell is the preserved exoskeleton of a haired spider.
		This spell is similar to a common 9th level wizard spell, except that it differs in the exact implementation of the effect, and is available to the practitioners of Chronomancy as an 8th level spell, due to the caster's advanced grasp of time manipulation.

		The caster focuses on a single moment in time - right now - and moves about within it. Objective time ceases to pass while they exist wholly within this moment, and all other creatures, objects, spells, and temporal events hang frozen.  From the caster's subjective perspective, this single moment in time seems to go on for 1d4 + 1 turns, during which the caster can use actions and move about more or less as normal.
		The caster's subjective jaunt through a frozen moment in time ends prematurely if any action or effect that they take or create affects another creature, or any object they wear or carry, as the effects of this perception of time at that point are no longer purely subjective. Additionally, time and space being intertwined, the effect ends if the caster moves farther than 1,000 feet away from the point in space where they began this moment in time.
		This spell is similar to a common 9th level wizard spell, except that it differs in the exact implementation of the effect, and is available to practitioners of Chronomancy as an 8th level spell, due to the caster's advanced grasp of the nature of time

		Duration: 10 minutes / level
		Area of Effect: 5 feet radius
		This spell creates a temporary bubble around the caster, which is excluded from the flow of time. While inside the bubble, the caster is immune to the passage of time, except as it applies directly to himself. The effect is that the world has frozen between seconds. This gives the caster an opportunity for actions like drinking Healing Potions, or letting a harmful spell, potion, or poison wear off. Once created, the bubble cannot be moved, and the caster cannot leave it without automatically dispelling the effect. Any creatures within the 5-foot radius are considered inside the bubble, and can interact with the caster as if normal time is passing. If they step outside the radius, they are immediately frozen in time until the spell expires, or the caster dispels it. The spell's duration is measured by the caster's subjective time.
		The material components of this spell require preparation. A crystal sphere valued at 1,000 gp or better is necessary. A diamond worth at least 5,000 gp must be enchanted with a Temporal Stasis spell and placed within the sphere. The entire device must then be touched by a Time Dimielemental while on the demiplane of time (touching does not have to be made voluntarily). When this spell is cast, the device is consumed by the magical energies.
		Based on the 2e ADnD spell Temporal Shell, from the Chronomancer suppliment (TSR 9506).

		This spell permanently detaches the caster from his lifeline. This negates the rule concerning doubling lifelines, and that's all most casters should know.
		The material components are a small silver knife enchanted to store a Lifeline Tether, and diamond dust worth 10,000 gp, sprinkled across the blade. This spell is cast while the caster is on the demiplane of time, and the knife is used to physically sever the caster's lifeline at the point it turns into the insubstantial silver mist trail.
		 DMs should know: severing one's lifeline essentially ends a character's life... at least in the traditional sense.  In some ways, this is analogous for the Chronomancer as lichdom is for a wizard, though they are not undead, nor does their alignment change as a result of the procedure.  Their mortal lifeline no longer extends into the future.  They are no longer considered 'natives' of the Prime Material, and are instead now considered natives of the demiplane of time.  If they are destroyed, their essence returns to the demiplane of time, and their soul is lost.  They can no longer go to any heaven or hell, nor become petitioners to any of the gods or Outer Planes, as they are already essentially 'petitioners' of Time. This is true unless direct intervention from one of the Major Powers (or a DM-decided method of altering this state of existence) occurs.  They are no longer temporally linear beings, and can be banished from the Prime Material as though Outsiders.  They can no longer be affected by paradoxes, and no longer cause paradoxes by visiting their own past history.  They are now susceptible to any spell or effect that damages or disrupts a native creature of the demiplane of time.  Their fate and ultimate well-being is now directly linked to the fate and well-being of the temiplane of time and the Timestreams.  Guardians of the demiplane of time will almost certainly attempt to contact any Chronomancer who severs their own lifeline as soon as possible, for better or worse.
		Inspired by the 2e ADnD spell Sever Lifeline, from the Chronomancer suppliment (TSR 9506).

		Range: 1 year into the past / level
		This spell changes an important event in the caster's past. This is just like Create Paradox, but the event can be as far back as one year past. Such an event could be changing from a Historian to a Seer, acquiring a proficiency in Prophecy rather than Alchemy, or deciding to research a new spell rather than create a new magical item, to name a few examples. The event must be one the caster had adequate control of at the time, and something should always be given up for whatever is gained. The change should always be evident, but not necessarily work out the way the caster/player expects. The DM should also feel free to remove any items or relationships he feels would not have been found as a result of the caster's meddling, and add any items or relationships that now would have been instead, for better and for worse. After all, the things that are changed were likely important to the caster at one time. The turbulence caused by casting Create Major Paradox has a 50% chance of attracting a Time Demielemental or a Chronomancer guardian from the demiplane of time.
		Based on the 2e ADnD spell Major Paradox, from the Chronomancer suppliment (TSR 9506).

		You create small pockets of time where you can manipulate the time within it in slight ways. The area these small pockets of time cover are just 5' cubed areas and within them you can reverse, freeze and accelerate time respectively. You initially can only create one pocket, but as you go up in level you will be able to create more.
		Reverse Time: You can reverse a series of events within a 10 minute span of time inside the pockets of time you create, this only affects nonliving objects and it does not really reverse time. It merely places things back to the way they were up to 10 minutes in the past, this adjustment happens in the span of just one round. This can only be done outside of combat as it requires too much concentration. The effects of this spell can mend non magical items, but it does not change any effects that may have occurred from the items moving in the first place. For example, if a lever was switched, the spell will merely reset the switch, but if there was a triggered event created by moving the switch in the first place, it may still be in effect. This is up to DM discretion.
		Freeze Time: You are able to freeze time in these respective pockets so that your own spells will not affect those within them. Any area effect spell that you cast that includes those pockets of time makes anyone within them immune to that spells effects until start of your next turn.
		Accelerate Time: You are able to give those who are standing in these pockets +2 on Initiative. This must be cast prior to initiating combat, typically this is usually only available if you and your group are initiating combat as the locations of the pockets need to be determined beforehand.
		The number of pockets you can create increases by 2 when you reach 5th level, 11th level, and 17th level

		You focus on channeling your own immediate future into a target, giving them more time to complete their tasks.
		Select a living creature you can see.  So long as you can continue to see them, they get to take a turn on their initiative, and another turn on your initiative each round.  As you continue to pour your own immediate future into them, you forfeit each of your turns for as long as you continue to concentrate on the spell.
		Casting this spell on a non-linear creature (for example, a native of the Demiplane of Time) has an unusual effect.  Instead of granting the target an extra turn on your initiative, you heal them of 2d8 + 1/level damage for each turn you continue concentrating.  You still forfeit your own turn when doing so.
		You may also cast this on an object or abstract scenario.  For as long as you continue to concentrate, candles and fuses don't burn out, hourglasses never run out, falling objects somehow never quite hit the ground, flying arrows never quite reach their targets, etc.  Whatever the scenario or object, you buy just 'a little more time' before the undesired effect occurs.
		A single casting may be maintained for up to an hour, but the spell may be cast again at the end of each hour to extend this limit another hour without interrupting the effect.
		At Higher Levels:
		For each level of spell slot above 2nd, you may target 1 additional creature, object, or abstract scenario.

	<abilities>
			<name>Conviction of the Shroud</name>
			<text>
				Some Mist Walkers delve so deeply into their studies of the Mist, that they learn to manifest its raw energy with added effects. These Mist Walkers manipulate the mist to their advantage and push the boundaries of its true capabilities. As much scholars as warriors, these Mist Walkers frequently become obsessed with unraveling the Mist's secrets and often feel a call to explore the ruins of lost civilizations and ancient tombs in search of unlocking its mystery.
				Features
			</text>
			<name>Conviction of the Mind</name>
			<text>
				Some Mist Walkers believe that only by strengthening their allies, can they achieve total dominance over their opponents. These Mist Walkers spend countless hours perfecting their ability to walk the Mist - so much so that they gain the ability to guide their allies through the Mist, and eventually their foes as well. For these Mist Walkers, the key to swift victory, is understanding the battlefield in its entirety, and controlling the positioning and flow of combat.
				Features
			</text>
			<name>Conviction of the Blade</name>
			<text>
				Some Mist Walkers believe that the Mist is a tool to gain an advantage over their foes in combat. It allows them to strike hard at a specific target to confuse their enemies. By cutting the head off of the snake for an enemy force, the remaining opponents often become panicked and disorganized, making them much easier to deal with. Thus by focusing their time to master the blade, they can truly become deadly warriors on the battlefield.

				Beginning at 1st level, you gain the ability to Mist Walk, allowing you to teleport short distances. As part of your movement, you may teleport to another empty space you can see within your Mist Walk distance as shown in the Mist Walk column of the Mist Walker table. The distance you can Mist Walk increases as you gain levels in the class. Using Mist Walk does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
				You may choose instead to break up your movement by moving up to half your movement speed and using your Mist Walk ability for up to half your current Mist Walk Distance. You may take these forms of movement in any order, and you may still take additional actions between these movements as normal. You can only Mist Walk once per turn as part of your movement (this excludes shroud abilities). You may not combine your Mist Walk ability with a Dash action.
				Upon reaching 5th level in this class, you can additionally teleport up to half of your Mist Walk Distance if you have used your Mist Walk ability as part of your move action this turn, or your full Mist Walk Distance if you have not, as a Bonus Action.
			</text>
			<level>20</level>
			<name>Mist Clone</name>
			<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>
			<text>
				At 20th level, you can shape the Mist around you to form a tangible duplicate of yourself to aid you in combat. As an action, choose an unoccupied space within your Mist Walk Distance. A clone of yourself appears in that square and is physically identical to you in appearance, including carried equipment - with the exception that all carried equipment on the clone has no magical properties. This ability lasts for 1 minute and cannot be used again until you finish a long rest.
				The clone's ability scores, hit points, proficiency bonus and AC are identical to your stats at the moment of activating this ability, excluding any additional magic bonus(es) you might have had active - with the exception that the damage it deals is magical for the purpose overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
				In addition it uses your Intelligence modifier for all attack and damage rolls, and any attacks that the clone makes use only the base damage for the weapon it is wielding, regardless if the weapon(s) you were wielding had additional magical properties when activating this ability.
				For example, if you were wielding a magic +2 shortsword when activating this ability, the clone's shortsword would be identical to yours in appearance, but deal 1d6 magic damage.
				If the clone is required to make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add your Intelligence modifier to determine whether it succeeds or fails.
				As the clone is formed through your deep connection to the Mist, it can fight alongside you without requiring actions to issue it commands. Acting on your turn, you may have the duplicate take the following actions, in addition to its move action:
				<list>
					The clone can take the attack action, including an extra attack, and can take a bonus action to attack if you were wielding two weapons when you created the duplicate.
					The clone can interact with an object.
					The clone can Mist Walk up to half of your Mist Walk distance as part of an action.
					The clone can take the Help action.
				</list>
				The clone cannot speak or take any additional actions, reaction, or bonus actions other than the ones listed above, except actions taken in attempt to free itself from a spell or condition - like escaping a grapple or trying to break free from a Web spell.
				If the clone's hit points drop to 0 or if a spell or effect would cause it to no longer be on the same plane of exsistence as you, it is destroyed. It is also immune to being charmed, frightened, petrified, poisoned and paralyzed.

			<level>18</level>
			<name>Greater Mist Walk</name>
			<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>
			<text>
				Starting at 18th level, as an action, you may use the Teleport spell as though you have cast it, without requiring spell components. If you target only yourself, you regain use of this ability after a long rest. If you target two or more creatures, you regain use of this ability after 1d6 days.

				When reaching 2nd level in this class you gain access to the following Shroud Abilities.
				Cloaking Mist (Shroud Ability)
				As an action, you may spend 1 shroud point to create a 30-foot-radius sphere of dark mist centered on yourself. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.
				Veiled Shield (Shroud Ability)
				As a reaction, whenever another creature hits you with a melee attack, you may spend 1 shroud point to add a +2 bonus to your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you. This bonus increases to +3 when you reach level 10th in this class, and to a +4 when you reach level 20 in this class.
				Jaunt (Shroud Ability)
				As a reaction, you may spend 1 shroud point to Mist Walk up to half your Mist Walk Distance to another unoccupied space, whenever you take damage. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
			</text>
			<level>2</level>
			<name>Shroud</name>
			<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>
			<text>
				Beginning at 2nd level, you tap further into the secrets of mist, giving you access to manifest and manipulate it as a tangible force, called the shroud.
				Shroud Points
				You have 2 shroud points and you gain additional shroud points as you level, as represented by the Shroud Points column of the Mist Walker table. Shroud points are spent to activate your shroud abilities. You regain all expended shroud points whenever you complete a long rest.
				Some of your Shroud Abilities require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
				Shroud Ability save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
			</text>
			<level>2</level>
			<name>Fighting Style</name>
			<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>

			<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>
			<text>
				Beginning at 7th level, your instinctive connection to the Mist allows you escape from the danger of certain area effects, such as a Red Dragon's Fiery-breath or a Fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, if you succeed on the saving throw you may use your reaction to Mist Walk to the nearest unoccupied square, up to half your Mist Walk distance, and instead you take no damage.

				Starting at 17th level, you move so fluidly through the Mist, it is difficult for your foes to track you. When you use Mist Walk as part of a move action, you may then cast Mirror Image as a bonus action without requiring spell components.

				Starting at 15th level, you can make a calculated strike against a foe in an attempt to exploit their defenses. As a bonus action you can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check of DC 15 to study one creature you can see within 50 feet of you. You make this check at disadvantage if the creature is an Aberration or a Construct. This check only determines any openings in the target's defense and does not yield any additional information like resistances the creature may have. This effect ends at the end of combat.
				The next time you successfully hit the target with a weapon attack, you deal an additional 12d10 force damage. Once you have successfully triggered the additional force damage, you may not use this ability again until you finish a short rest.

				When the target appears at the chosen space, any creatures within 5 feet may use their reaction to make a single attack against the target. If the target succeeds it's saving throw, nothing happens.

				Starting at 15th level, you can harness the raw power of the Mist to bolster you and your allies. As an action choose a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier within your Mist Walk Distance. Those creatures become sheathed in a dark purple mist. Whenever one of those creatures starts their turn within half your Mist Walk Distance from you, that creature gains a +2 bonus to their AC, and additional 1d4 temporary hit points, and they cannot be magically slowed. This effect lasts for 1 minute.
				Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

				Beginning at 15th level, whenever an ally that you can see that is within your Mist Walk Distance is the target of an attack, after the die is rolled, but before the Dungeon Master declares whether the hit was successful, you can, as a reaction attempt to swap the places of that ally and another creature of your choice - potentially having the new creature take the attack instead.
				Choose one medium sized or smaller creature within your Mist Walk Distance that you can see. If the target is a willing target, switch the target's position with your ally. Then, apply the original attack to the new creature, using its AC to determine the success or failure of the attack. If it hits, the attack deals damage to the new creature and applies any additional abilities, conditions, saving throws, etc. to the new creature as normal.
				If the target is an unwilling creature, it must succeed a Wisdom saving throw or be forced to swap places with your ally and take the attack. Once you have used this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short rest.

				At 11th level, your ability to track multiple enemies on the battlefield is uncanny. Whenever a creature within 30 feet of you, that you can see and hear, begins to cast a spell, you can use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space next to the target and make a single attack against them. If you hit, the target must make a Constitution saving throw as normal or lose the spell.

The target must be medium size or smaller, and appears in an unoccupied square next to your target square. If there isn't an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your arrival point, the target is moved to the nearest unoccupied square and takes 2d6 points of force damage, for every 5 feet it is forced to move.
				The creature has advantage on the next attack it makes before the end of its next turn. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence modifier.
				When you reach 13th level in this class, you can use this ability a number of times per day equal to twice your Intelligence modifier.

			<text>
				Starting at 3rd level, you gain the following additional Shroud Abilities:
				Oppressive Haze (Shroud Ability)
				As bonus action, you may spend 3 Shroud Points to choose one creature you can see within 10 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or else it is surrounded in an oppressive gray mist, which lasts for 1 minute.
				An affected target's speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.
				If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.
				A creature affected by this ability makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.
				Disarming Mist (Shroud Ability)
				As a bonus action, whenever you hit a creature with an attack, you may spend 2 Shroud Points to attempt to disarm your opponent using the Mist to aid you. The target makes a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to avoid having a weapon that it is currently wielding be teleported through the Mist to a space of your choosing within 30 feet. If the target succeeds its saving throw, nothing happens.
				Obstructing Shroud (Shroud Ability)
				As a bonus action, you may spend 2 Shroud Points to choose one large size or smaller creature you can see within 10 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or else it has disadvantage on attacks until the end of its next turn.

				Choose any number of creatures within the affected area. Those creature must succeed a Constitution saving throw or have their life force ripped from them. Each target takes 4d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
				Then, any number of creatures within the mist may ain hit points equal to the total damage dealt by this ability. The total number of hit points gained this way, must be divided among the new targets, in a manner of your choosing.
				You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence modifier.

				At 7th level, as an action you can exude a wave of poisonous green mist around you. You create a 30 foot sphere of mist centered on your space that lasts for 1 minute.
				Each creature that is completely within the mist at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while coughing and gasping uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.
				A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the mist after 3 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.
				You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to twice your Intelligence modifier.

				Beginning at 3rd level you have learned to tap into the more mystic forces of the Mist to aid your allies at the cost of your own life essence. As an action you may touch one creature and transfer part of your life force to them. Roll 1d6 and add your Intelligence modifier, the target creature regains hit points equal to the total. You then take 1d6 necrotic damage, this damage may not be prevented in any way. If the necrotic damage would reduce your hit points to 0, you drop to 1 hit point instead and your target receives no healing benefit from this ability.
				The amount of life force you can transfer to your allies with this ability increases as you level. When reaching 7th level, you may choose to roll 2d6 for both rolls instead of 1d6, at 11th level you may choose to roll up to 3d6 for each roll, at 15th level you may choose to roll up to 4d6 for both rolls, and at 19th level you may choose to roll up to 5d6 for each roll. You still add the Intelligence modifier to the amount of hit points the target gains if you decide to add additional dice this way.
				You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to twice your Intelligence modifier.

They gain a number of hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier. This number increases to twice your Intelligence modifier when you reach 9th level, and three times your Intelligence modifier at 15th level.

		The Mist Walker
		Focusing his mind on the brightly colored armor, the man stalks his target, making his way through the chaos of the battle around him. He closes his eyes and feels his bodybecome one with the mist. In a blink of an eye he's on top of the enemy commander - a whirling blade of death.
		The Elf exhales a final breath to ready herself. In a flash she disappears, only to reappear behind the unexpecting headsman. A shroud of mist covers her true actions, and in a matter of seconds she and the doomed man she was hired to save are running along the rooftops, making their way to the safehouse.
		Recovering quickly from the initial blast, the Tiefling scans the ambushers for the origin of the assault. Spotting a robed half-orc wielding a glowing staff, she reaches out her hand and soon a red swirl of mist appears around her and the half-orc. She can feel the magical exchange of life easing the pain from her fresh burns and a smile spreads across her face as the half-orc lets out a howling scream of anguish.
		Whatever the origin of their connection to the mists, one thing is for sure, those who can tap into and harness the ability to walk the mists, leave both devastation and confusion in their wake.
		Cunning Warriors
		To be counted among those who can walk the mists is no easy feat and as such, Mist Walkers are incredibly dedicated warriors. Focusing their mind to absorb the entirety of their surroundings they track their enemies and engage them at blinding speeds - often from behind. The mental fortitude it takes to harness the power of the mists, while engaged in the throes of combat is significant.
		Mist walkers strike fast and hard against their most dangerous foes, and just as abruptly as they appear, they're gone - already calculating their next attack. Speed and surprise are a Mist Walker's greatest asset, which is probably why so many favor a pair of shorter blades - though some Mist Walkers still prefer to fight with shield, knowing that they so often find themselves behind enemy lines.
		Still some prefer to further engage their enemies from a distance, mixing their skill with a bow with the ability to manipulate the mists to cripple their foes and aid their allies.
		Battlefield Strikers
		Due to the nature of their abilities and intellectual aptitude, Mist Walkers excel at two professions in particular: that of the soldier, and assassin.
		Mist Walkers have been rumored to be responsible for armies suddenly finding themselves without a commanding officer - whether on the field of battle, or during the night before a siege - where the lines between soldier and assassin become blurred.
		Naturally those organizations who deal in death for profit, attract Mist Walkers who have less-than-honorable morals, and likewise Mist Walkers often find those particular organizations eager to give them an opportunity to prove their worth.
		Creating a Mist Walker
		Mist Walking is not something innate, but rather a skill that is studied, practiced and honed. Not only do Mist Walkers have to learn how to harness the raw energy of the mist, but they also go through rigorous martial training. Bringing the two arts together is still a feat in itself. As such, most Mist Walkers receive some form of formal training - whether through their service in a standing army, an apprenticeship in an order of assassins, or perhaps they were cultivated from birth in the ancient traditions of their remote mountain village.
		When creating a Mist Walker consider their upbringing and how they might have had access to such unique training. The environment in which they were trained, as well as their instructors, will typically have a significant impact on their personality and overall worldview.
		Perhaps the artform of Mist Walking was not passed down from a formal instructor but rather something you
		discovered in an ancient tome - with your Mist Walker spending countless hours pouring over the text and practicing it's teachings. How would your Mist Walker decide to put this new power to use? Why would they feel the need to study an, ultimately, deadly martial artform? Is it to gain an edge over a rival? Or perhaps it's because they had a specific use in mind, and they needed a way to escape quickly.
		Quick Build
		You can make a Mist Walker quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score if you plan on wielding two light weapons, or Strength if you plan on using one weapon and a shield (Some Mist Walkers who focus on two-weapon fighting make Strength higher than Dexterity). Your next-highest score should be Intelligence, or Constitution if you plan to take the Conviction of the Blade. Second, choose a background for your character.

				At 5th level the Dragon Lord gains his first and most loyal companion, a wyrmling of its favored dragon type. The Dragon's will and soul are linked to the Dragon Lord's. The wyrmling may NOT use its breath ability. When you gain your dragon wyrmling companion, it has 25 hit points.
				To be separated from one another for too long is physically painful for both parties and will result in a -1 to constitution for every day past 7 days to a maximum of -7 until reunited at +2 immediately and +1 everyday after till back to normal.
				The dragon has separate initiative and acts at the will of the Dragon Lord through their psychic link. If the Dragon falls in combat the Dragon Lord receives disadvantage on all rolls except death saves. If the Dragon Lord falls in combat the dragon becomes insane and attacks all creatures in the area until all are dead or the Dragon Lord is revived to assume control. If the dragon is slain and can't be revived. The Dragon Lord receives a 50% penalty to hp until the 7 day period it takes for a new soul link to be formed with a dragon of suitable age.
				At 10th level the wyrmling and has 50 hit points. The soul link is fully matured and allows for the transfer of HP between the Dragon Lord and his dragon. Once per long rest provided the giver has 50% of its total HP, and the receiver less than 50%, you may choose to roll 1d6 per Dragon Lord level and the amount rolled is transferred to the receiver. The number of d6&#146;s you may roll is limited to your number of Dragon Lord levels.
				At 15 th level, your wyrmling matures into a Young Dragon of the same type, and you have the ability to ride it. While riding in combat, your dragon loses its independence in the turn order, and on your turn, you may choose to make a ranged attack yourself (if you can) or use one of your dragon&#146;s abilities. You can use all your movement and an action to dismount, or mount your dragon. Whilst riding your dragon, melee attack rolls against you have disadvantage, while ranged attacks have advantage if you are not currently flying. If you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die whilst riding your dragon, you fall off and your dragon must make a Constitution saving throw to remain flying, if it fails, it falls. Falling more than 30 feet while at 0 HP for either the dragon or the Dragon Lord results in DEATH!
				Notes regarding 15th+ level Young Dragon:
				<list>
					Your dragon has 100 HP
					Your dragon can only attack once per turn
					Your breath attack (if any) deals only 21 (6d6) damage

		The Dragon Lord is born not made. For some reason beyond the knowledge of the mortal races Bahamut or Tiamat has chosen this particular mortal to be their conduit into the world.
		Driven from Birth
		The Dragon Lord is driven from birth to be the best at everything they attempt and are often if not always the most skilled and talented warriors. Anyone who has seen one will atest to that fact if they are still alive to tell the tale. The Dragon Lords drive is what leads them to be not only proficient but a master with all types of weapons and armor.
		Racial Restriction
		No race that is created and not born may play Dragon Lord. A Dragonborn Dragon Lord's Family and type must follow his Draconic Ancestry.

				The Station of the Harbinger is seemingly the most powerful of the stations, having roots in divine and arcane practices and created specifically to rid the realms of the scourge of the evil beasthood. Harbingers seek immortality for immortality's sake. Special study of Beasts, Dragons, and deities become obsession to try and learn power and perhaps ways to elongate life itself.

				When the mind mixes with the power of alchemy, results can be fantastic. Granting possible great powers, it can also be a painful (even fatal) experience. Those that learn and master the great science will undoubtedly find themselves balanced, hardened, changed, enhanced, and maybe experience untold mental horrors. Through concentration, study, and alchemy, these scientists were able to discover powerful toxoid recipes.
				Over generations of experimentation, an offshoot station of Defiers emerged, one that focused on brewing toxic elixirs to modify their capabilities in battle, and over time become something beyond themselves. They are called the Station of the Sly.

			<text>
				Ages past, a vile evil rose to power in the form of mysterious aberrations that devastated the living with such brutality that it broke the minds of many a Defier who bore witness. A few courageous, and possibly insane defiers saw that such perversion could only be fought if you studied it, embraced it, and used it against itself. These few sought to gain the knowhow to control this power and use it for their own purpose.
				Developing this new skill, they brought to an end the horrible aberrant powers, but not without personal payment. Understanding the potential power, and subsequent burdens of this new mastery, it allowed for the acquisition of spellcraft. Thus began a new sect of Defiers. They called themselves the Station of the Tortured Mind.

				As a bonus action, you can draw power from your mind to create extra focus. It invokes tremendous mental pain, temporarily reducing your maximum hit points a number equal to your character level. These lost hit points are regained after your next long rest, and cannot be healed or restored otherwise.
				Until your next long rest, that weapon flares with mental energy, granting you a + 1 bonus to attack rolls made with it. Attacks from the weapon are considered magical, and it deals an additional 1d4 damage. The damage type is based on a chosen custom. This die changes as you gain Defier levels, as shown in the Mind Focus damage die column of the Defier table. These benefits are cumulative with weapon enchantments, and disappear should anyone but you attempt to use the weapon. Mind Focus can be used on multiple weapons, costing additional hit point loss. If used on a weapon already given an active Mind Focus, the old ordinance immediately fades as the new one takes effect. Ordinance weapons can be sheathed safely without fading.
				You gain access to an additional Soul Custom at 6th level and 9th level. You can choose to learn one Greater Soul Custom at 13th level.

				Ordinance of Ice - Your Mind Focus damage type is Cold.

				Cantrips

				Spell Slots
				The Tortured Mind Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.
				For example, when you are 8th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell magic missile, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.
				Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
				At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from any of the class spell lists.
				The Spells Known column of the Tortured Mind table shows when you learn more spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 13th level, for example, you learn a new spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.
				Additionally, when you gain a level in this class and station, you can choose one of the spells you know and replace is with another spell from any spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
				Spellcasting Ability
				Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
				Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
				Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

		Defier
		<linklist>
			<link class="imagewindow" recordname="image.id-00002">Image: Defier</link>
		</linklist>
		The world is a complicated and most often scary place. When the likes of fighters, magic users, and healers rome the land, there are those who remain more a mystery.
		A new element has arisen of late, a being, perhaps more than one, whose mastery of the arcane and divine rings supposition and terror as rumors spread. Power, desire, and skill, this is the Defier.
		WELCOME ALL TROUBLE
		Defiers have a pact with the divine and the arcane powers of the worlds. They pursue knowledge and power. Evil, good, or somewhere in between, the Defier is a mystery to most. Having a keen sense of mind, they are trained in the arts of persuasion and intimidation. They are rumored to make alliances with any manner of person or beast in hopes of gaining favor, power, or even attributes through physical or magical means.
		With a focussed mind, they are experts in subterfuge, they can both befriend and kill anyone at any time. Unpredictable to be sure, they are feared because so little is known about them.
		AS FEARED AS THEY ARE REVERED
		Most will avoid Defiers, and they are not quick to engage others as well. Unless there is gain, they keep a discreet distance. When they do interact, well versed and trained in social interaction, they can easily speak with and engage in proper conversation due the the chameleonesque nature of their personality. Blending in with a band of rebels, a guild of thieves, or a pontification of clerics, being a part of a group is an easy transition when necessary.
		CREATING A DEFIER
		As you create your Defier, be mindful of the goals and purposes to undertake. Are they out for vengeance? Do they seek ultimate power and control? Was there a tragedy from the past that took family or friends? What drives them forward on their quest?
		While a Defier is solitary in nature, they will travel with groups and even make themselves useful. But everything is done for a reason, and for ultimate gain. Whether it be good or bad.
		QUICK BUILD
		You can make a Defier quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score. Make Wisdom your next highest if you plan to focus on mystical power by following the Station of the Tortured Mind or Harbinger. Choose a higher Constitution instead if you wish to toy with toxoids via the Station of the Sly or use Mind Focus on your weapons.

				</traits>
		</subraces>
			A Friendly Folk
			When the humans and the vesses arrived in the Middle Enclosure, they found the dragonborn there waiting for them. Contrary to their fearsome appearance, the dragonborn welcomed these refugees into their camps and villages with open arms, teaching them their simple ways of hunting, fishing, and farming.
			In the age following the fall of the kingdoms of Kynera, the dragonborn grew to be an integral part of society. Even to this day it is not uncommon to find dragonborn in places of honor within the tribes and clans of the Middle Enclosure.
			Cultural Amnesia
			The dragonborn have no historical recollection of how they arrived in the Middle Enclosure. Some of their elders maintain that the dragonborn have always been there around the Almena Sea, while others believe that they were expelled by the mountains surrounding the Middle Enclosure as their god Arlifon breathed them into existence.
			The earliest historical texts that the dragonborn have is the Vestirand Codex, said to be handed down to them directly by their god so that they might know how to live. The Codex itself is a series of morality tales, parables, vocally driven songs, rhythmic dances, shamanistic rituals that often involve teeth, and preparations of herbs for use in their smoking tents.
			The Divided Dragonborn
			Dragonborn often divide themselves along the lines of metallic and chromatic ancestries, with each group preferring to keep to themselves and not intermingle with the other. While it is very common to find vastly more of one type within a clan or tribe than the other, this preference is very seldom due to racism or prejudice, but rather a difference of attitudes and ideals.
			Metallic dragonborn tend to be slow to act and even slower to anger, favoring wisdom and strategy over brute force. On the other hand, chromatic dragonborn tend to be quick to act and even quicker to anger, often preferring to meet a problem head on without delay.
			Despite this difference of temperament and their cultural separation, there is a dragonborn legend about a pair of star-crossed dragonborn lovers and their travels as they chased one another around the Middle Enclosure, one a white dragonborn shaman, the other a silver dragonborn huntress.
			Dragonborn Traits
			Your draconic heritage manifests in a variety of traits you share with other dragonborn.
			Dragonborn Ancestries
			There are many different types of dragonborn that are quite different in the lands of Kynera, choose from the options provided below:
		<traits>
				<name>Age</name>
					Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.
				<name>Alignment</name>
					Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil (represented by Arlifon and Bandonelm, respectively). Most dragonborn are good, but those who side with Bandonelm can be terrible villains.
				<name>Size</name>
					Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.
				<name>Speed</name>
					Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

				<name>Breath Weapon</name>
					You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
				<name>Languages</name>
					You can speak, read, and write your Common tribal dialect and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.
				<name>Dragonborn Ancestry</name>
					There are many different types of dragonborn that are quite different in the lands of Kynera, choose from the options provided below:
		</traits>
	<name>Human</name>
		<subraces>
				<name>Usone</name>
					The usone are descended from humans that lacked the innate magical nature of the kynerans and account for roughly ninety percent of the human population in Kynera. Within human society usone make up the commoner caste. Usone are incredibly diverse culturally and can be found in virtually every tribe in Kynera.
					Traits
				<traits>
						<name>Age</name>

							You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.
						<name>Feat</name>

				</traits>
				<name>Tiurhan</name>
					The tiurhan are the descendants of humans that once lived deep within the Kyneran Empire. Tiurhan have an appearance similar to other humans except for the bull-like horns sprouting from either side of their head. Tiurhan are generally revered as those touched by Tiur the Bull God, serving as shamans for their tribes.
					Traits
				<traits>
						<name>Ability Score Increase</name>
							Your Charisma score increases by 1 and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.
						<name>Keeper of Tales</name>
							Your people are renowned storytellers whose oral traditions pass down all manner of fables from ages past. Whenever you make a Charisma (Performance) check to tell a story or a Intelligence (History) check to recall one, you are considered proficient in that skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.
						<name>Tribal Bond</name>
							Your tribe comes first and foremost, they are not just your blood but the people around you and their families. You have advantage on saving throw against being charmed or frightened while an allied creature is within 10 feet of you.
						<name>Age</name>
							Tiurhan reach adulthood in their late teens and generally live around a century and a half.
						<name>Horns of the Bull God</name>
							Your horns are natural melee weapons, with which you're proficient. When you hit with them, the target takes piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.
						<name>Bull's Rush</name>
							Immediately after you use the Dash action on your turn and move at least as far as your speed, you can make one melee attack with your horns as a bonus action.
				</traits>
				<name>Sonis</name>

						<name>Age</name>
							Sonis reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.
						<name>Ability Score Increase</name>
							You gain 5 points with which to increase your ability scores. You may not increase an ability score by more than 2 points with this feature.
				</traits>
				<name>Osyn</name>
					Osyn typically live in sub-arctic climates where they have adapted well to the colder conditions. These humans often live in wandering hunter bands that will build semi-permanent tent cities in the summer and move on to more durable stone structures farther away from the hunting grounds as the seasons change. Shorter than typical humans, osyn are bulkier around the shoulders with barrel chests. Their brows are more pronounced and chins recessed. Skin tones vary from fair to tan with dark brown eyes and hair common.
					While most osyn live a hunter-gatherer lifestyle they are not, as some baseline humans would like to believe, stupid. They have a rich oral tradition with epics that reach back into times of legend and produce 'simple' art that can convey powerful yet subtle emotions. Many people claim that osyn are born to be nothing more than savages in the wilds but most large villages will have an osyn enclave with a diverse and urban population.
					Traits
				<traits>
						<name>Hurling</name>
							Thanks to their stronger shoulder musculature and slightly more flexible spines osyn can make thrown weapons go slightly farther. When you throw a ranged weapon, its normal and long ranges increase by 10 feet.
						<name>Snowborn</name>

					Traits
				<traits>
						<name>Ability Score Increase</name>
							Your ability scores each increase by 1.
						<name>Age</name>
							Atarr reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

			A Fallen Empire
			Humans once lived throughout the entirety of Kynera, but that age is long past. Now two distinct groups of humans live in small shamanistic tribal villages and nomadic bands that scavenge the ruins of once great kingdoms.
			A Broad Spectrum
			With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of altari, esunite, or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.
			Variety in All Things
			Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build villages to last for the ages, and great clans that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human's memory. They live fully in the present-making them well suited to the adventuring life-but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.
			Lasting Institutions
			Where a single person might take on the responsibility of guarding a special location or a powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and institutions for such purposes. Clans and elders pass on the ancient traditions to each new generation, human shamans, tribes, shrines, and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream of immortality, but (except for those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to escape death's clutches) they achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when they are gone.
			Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general their societies are inclusive. Human lands welcome large numbers of nonhumans compared to the proportion of humans who live in nonhuman lands.
			Exemplars of Ambition
			Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and ambitious members of a daring and ambitious race. They seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More than other people, humans champion causes rather than territories or groups.
			Human Traits
			It's hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.
			Human Ancestries
			There are many different types of humans that are quite different in the lands of Kynera, choose from the options provided below:
		<traits>
			<alignment>
				<name>Alignment</name>
					Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.

		<subraces>
				<name>Byorn</name>
					The byorn are large, fur-covered humanoid bear folk. While large, rugged, and imposing, the byorn are stalwart allies, there's a saying in the Middle Enclosure, "Befriend a bjorn, you'll be friends beyond the wall." Known for their dual nature, the byorn's moods are tied to the seasons. Byorn are generally lethargic and sleepy in the winter months, and active and outgoing during the summer months.
					Traits
				<traits>
						<name>Ability Score Increase</name>
							Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.
						<name>Size</name>
							Byorn are between 8 and 9 feet tall and weigh between 380 and 440 pounds. Your size is Medium.
						<name>Speed</name>
							Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
						<name>Powerful Build</name>
							You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
						<name>Thick Fur</name>
							You're acclimated to high altitude, including elevations above 20,000 feet. You're also naturally adapted to cold climates.
						<name>Threatening Growl</name>
							You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.
						<name>Brutal Attacks</name>
							When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.
						<name>Tooth and Claw</name>
							Your teeth and claws are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you can deal piercing (teeth) or slashing (claws) damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
				</traits>
				<name>Nyol</name>
					At first glance, one might mistake a nyol for a human until they notice the cat-like ears and tail they possess. Because the Nyol are semi-nocturnal, preferring to nap during the day and spend their nights working or hunting, its is easy to assume that they are lazy but this could not be further from the truth. The nyol are cunning planners and strategists, and often excel at anything they set their mind to.
					Traits
				<traits>
						<name>Ability Score Increase</name>
							Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.
						<name>Size</name>
							Nyol range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.
						<name>Speed</name>
							Your base walking speed is 35 feet.
						<name>Darkvision</name>
							Your eyes take in much more light than other creatures. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

						<name>Cat Nap</name>
							Nyol do not sleep. Instead they nap lightly, remaining semi-conscious, for 12 hours a day. The Common expression for this is "cat-napping". While napping, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises like hunting that have become reflexive after years of practice. You can break this rest up in as short as 2-hour increments but no longer than 6 hours. After resting 12 hours in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.

			A Diverse Folk
			The vesses are actually several races and not one single race as they are often referred to. Put simply, the vesses are an assortment of different beast-folk.
			The form of a vesse can be very animalistic like the salamander-like odyla or the bear-like byorn, or much more human-like with some animal feature such as the fox-like features of the raiv or the feline attributes of the nyol.
			Former Servants
			Ancient lore says that the ens and the humans created the vesses to serve them in their magical cities, although if that is true, the methods of their creation vanished along with the kynerans and their magics. Some proud vesse elders believe that the vesses were not created, but instead were brought to Kynera from the lands beyond the eastern mountains, however there is little evidence to support these theories.
			Earning a Place
			In the distant past, the vesses served the kynerans and their human subjects, but after the fall of the ancients' civilization, the vesses proved themselves and finally earned their place as equals among the other races. Nowadays, the vesses can be found in almost all facets of the villages, clans, and tribes of the Middle Enclosure.
			Vesse Traits
			Though mostly distinct, your bestial ancestry manifests in a few traits you share with other vesses.
			Vesse Ancestries
			There are many different types of vesses that are quite different in the lands of Kynera, choose from the options provided below:

				<name>Languages</name>
					You can speak, read, and write your tribal dialect of Common and Undercommon. Undercommon is a harsh, grating language with hard consonants. It has no script of its own but is written in the Kydharr script.

			The winged folk resemble humes, except they have large feathery wings on their back. These wings can come in different colors, from brown to red to black. These wings allow the winged folk to fly with no problems. All winged folk are cold and aloof. They are either incapable at showing emotions, or do not feel them at all. The winged folk are not too keen on other races, since most of the Sky Pirates who arrived either attacked or enslaved them. Winged folk make their home in many stone edifices erected over several of Lemures' continents as well as in the north in Xytegenia and Galicia. These homes were built by the first generation of winged folk following their banishment by the Occuria. Successive generations have elected to inhabit these century-old dwellings rather than construct new ones, an effort made easier by the small winged folk population. According to the Folio, winged folk are mostly vegetarians, the majority of their diet being wild fruits and vegetables. The Damson, a plump red fruit that grows in the Bosco Pampa, appears to be their favorite. Winged folk harvest the waters of Lemur&#233;s for native fish, and eggs are also a part of their cuisine. However, other hunting sources are nonexistent, as the Yarhi beasts that would normally yield meat are but illusions, and fade to nothing when killed. Winged folk garb is light and geared for flight. Indeed, most winged folk males do not wear an upper garment, and winged folk armor is likewise sparsely distributed over the winged folk form. As Llyud exemplifies, winged folk jewelry is simplistic, being of lightweight gold and lacking in inlaid jewels. This absence of exquisite garments is yet another indication of winged folk humility.

				<name>Ability Score Increase</name>
					Your Dexterity score increases by 2.
				<name>Gliding Wings</name>
					Winged folk take no damage from falling (as if subject to a constant non-magical feather fall spell). While in midair, winged folk can move up to 5 feet in any horizontal direction for every 1 foot they fall, at a speed of 60 feet per round. A winged folk with gliding wings cannot gain height with these wings alone; it merely coasts in other directions as it falls. If subjected to a strong wind or any other effect that causes a creature with gliding wings to rise, it can take advantage of the updraft to increase the distance it can glide.
				<name>Alignment</name>
					Winged Folk tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.

If winged folk carry a heavy load or wear heavy armor, their flight speed drops to 30 feet. A winged folk's wing span is typically 12 feet, and cannot fly in an area that does not allow them to fully extend their wings.

			They often stand with a slight stoop, possibly from the weight of their masks. The masks are a vital part of garif customs and all garif receive a mask on the day they are born, which they wear until they die and will not remove, lend or sell. The great-chiefs wear more elaborate masks, wrought with metal and painted with pigments that most likely have come from the land.
			Despite their intimidating appearance, the garif are a peace-loving people, albeit physically capable of fighting and hunting thanks to their muscular bodies, thick fur and incredible hearing and sense of smell. Many garif become herders, overlooking livestock of creatures known as "Nanna" in the garif tongue. The garif milk these creatures to make Nanna-cheese, a product famous throughout Ivalice.

			The bangaa are a lizard-like race, widespread across Ivalice. They have long faces, scaly skin, and tough limbs. They have two long ears dangling from each side of their heads, leading people to call them "long-ears". Their sense of smell and hearing are exceptionally sharp. They have a tall stature and are physically powerful, but their vocal structure makes it difficult for them to cast incantations, limiting their use of magick.
			Due to their capacity in brute force, the bangaa are considered the most physically prominent of the Ivalice races. Voices aside, their reptilian appearance make it difficult to distinguish males and females. Their lifespan is roughly 1.5-2 times as long as a hume's.
			Calling a bangaa a "lizard" is considered a heinous racial slur. Another lizard-like race exists in Ivalice, generally referred to as the lizardmen, who are more primitive and violent than the bangaa, who resent the comparison. Unlike true reptiles, bangaa can grow facial hair.

	<name>Elezen</name>
		<subraces>
				<name>Duskwight</name>
					Centuries ago, a number of Elezen sought out a life of peace and seclusion in the depths of Ivalice's caves and caverns. Today, they are called the Duskwight, though to their Wildwood cousins they are known simply as the "Greys," after their preference for darkness and stone.
					These cave-dwelling Elezen are the descendants of a branch that split from the main Wildwood clan during the founding of Kerwon, choosing instead to remain in the stone-hewn chambers of Gelmorra or seek out new subterranean sanctums. The Duskwight despise the "shackles" of urban life, and it is not uncommon for them to avoid the city-states altogether.
					Some even resort to brigandry to survive and, as a result, they are often looked upon with scorn by the citizens of Dalmasca. Those who have chosen to make their home in the cities often suffer undue discrimination at the hands of their neighbors.

					The forests of Kerwon and Bolmocca have been home to the Wildwood Elezen for centuries. They are blessed with extremely keen eyesight and their fondness for law and order has contributed to a reputation for being haughty and argumentative. The clan is also known for its innovative genius, contributing greatly to the carpentry and leatherwork of Kerwon.
					Among their Duskwight brethren, Wildwood Elezen are referred to as "Greens," for their love of the forest. The name "Wildwood" is typically used to refer to the forest-dwelling Elezen of Kerwon, but those of Dalmasca share the same common ancestry. As such, Kerwon and Dalmasca have traditionally enjoyed close relations, with each nation coming to the other's aid in times of need.

			The tall and slender Elezen were once the predominant race in Ivalice. Believing the realm to be theirs by divine right - a gift from the Twelve themselves, they continue to harbor a deep pride at being the chosen race of the gods even to this day. While this originally led to conflict with the invading Hyur tribe during the early Sixth Astral Era, they reached a mutual understanding and work towards mutual peace and prosperity to this day.
			Both clans possess hearing keener than that of the other races', with the Duskwight possessing a particularly heightened sense of hearing - even among Elezen. Their lifespan is longer than the other races' by about one- or two-tenths.
			According to their histories, the Elezen were the original inhabitants of Ivalice in the First Astral Era, and continue to take pride in this heritage to this day. For much of their history, they lived pastoral lives on the vast, fertile plains. It seems that, during the time of the Ronkan Empire, a population of Elezen dwelled in Bolmocca. After the Calamity, they were again the most populous race in Ivalice, but were displaced by the great migratory waves of Hyur early into the Sixth Astral Era. Time and again, they waged bloody war with the Hyuran invaders.
			Some of those Elezen who left the plains of central Bolmocca settled in the highlands of Kerwon. Eventually, they founded the city-state of Kerwon.
			The Elezen who moved to the Mists after being displaced from their homes in central Bolmocca came into conflict with the Hyur yet again when the invaders sought to colonize the forest as well. Ultimately, to ensure their mutual survival against the elementals of the forest, they forged the Pact of Gelmorra and created the subterranean city-state of the same name. The Elezen of Kerwon would similarly come to welcome Hyur into their city-state.
			Eventually, the Elezen and Hyur would leave Gelmorra. As Elezen are very protective of their homes, a small but not insignificant portion of Gelmorra's Elezen citizenry refused to abandon their home. The descendants of these Elezen are the Duskwight, who largely continue to dwell in caverns and ancient ruins of their former city-state.

	<name>Hyur</name>
		<subraces>
				<name>Midlander</name>
					The Midlander clan comprises over half of the total population of Ivalice's Hyur. They have established themselves throughout every city in the realm and lead lives as diverse as their heritage, though they are marginally more common and prominent in Galicia. Trained in letters from infancy, the Midlanders are generally more educated than many of the other races and clans.

				</traits>
				<name>Highlander</name>
					The Highlanders derive their name from a long tradition of inhabiting Ivalice's mountainous regions, particularly Palantinus and its proud city-state of Hyland. Compared to their Midland brethren, the Highlanders are larger in build. Although Highlanders were originally common in Hyland, the state's conquest by Lodis has driven them all across Ivalice in great waves of refugees. The largest number of them can be found in and around Rabanastre, as the refugees were attracted by tales of Dalmascan wealth - only to learn of the other side of ruthless Dunesfolk business practices. Many are now found on the streets of Rabanastre, huddled outside its walls or in the refugee camp referred to (some would say mockingly) as "Little Hyland". However, the great Highlander diaspora did not just send them to Dalmasca, and they can be found more or less everywhere across Ivalice.

				<name>Guado</name>
					Tall and thinly built, with long limbs, large hands with prominent fingernails, and narrow, angular faces. Their skin is pale and somewhat translucent, and their features are often framed by a collection of thin blue veins that pulse underneath their skin. They have soft, melodious voices and are disinclined to be harsh. They are known for their brightly colored and wildly styled hair, often floral or tree-like. They are a somber and astute people, inclined towards traditionalism. Guados are most known for their connections to the forces of death and their links to the afterlife, often tasking themselves with protecting places with strong ties to other realms and planes of existence, especially those where souls are confirmed to reside after their death. Guados take well to the life of the faithful, and are often found as priests in places where they are not known to commonly reside, performing embalming services, funeral rites, and other rituals associated with death. However, their association with death has a habit of making them a bit alien or unnerving to other races, and Guados, as a result, tend to form their own communities outside of the settlements of other races, rather than intermingle freely.
					Traits
				<traits>
						<name>Ability Score Increase</name>
							Your Intelligence score increases by 1 and your Wisdom score increases by 2.

				</traits>
				<name>Al Bhed</name>
					Al Bhed differs only slightly from midlanders; in their bright green eyes with spiral-patterned irises. As a result, they often wear goggles. Another mark of the Al Bhed is that most of them have blond hair. The Al Bhed pride themselves on the usage of their specialized knowledge of ancient technology which they call "Machina". The Al Bhed are a people that have finally come into their own. Formerly branded dangerous heretics and shunned for their use of ancient technology, they are now heralded as the people who will bring Ivalice into a new golden age, with the technology cast off centuries ago. As to be expected, the Al Bhed are skilled with technology, and are also skilled seamen and miners, willing to do almost anything to get their hands on 'new' technology.

				</traits>
				<name>Genome</name>
					Genomes are a race of artificial humanoids created in production facilities. Due to the nature of their creation, the majority of the Genome population lack a soul, and have little to no emotional response; Genomes are nothing more than empty husks awaiting the attainment of a soul. A Genomes existence is perpetually incomplete until they receive a soul. As such, the collective Genome existence is dedicated to the preparation of attaining a soul, mentally and physically. The Genomes also seem to know a great deal of the Soul Cycle and the world in which they live. Although this knowledge is useless to a vessel who will soon forget what they have learned upon receiving a soul, information is circulated among the population to prevent mental decay. The Genomes harbor production facilities in which they create more of their race. Through these production facilities, they aim to create a more suitable vessel for a soul to reside in. This could also be interpreted as somewhat recreational due to their seemingly meaningless existence. Genomes are normally isolated, creating villages around their production facilities. Because of this, when a Genome attains a soul, it is not uncommon for them stay with their own kind. A Genome found away from one of these villages was probably sent to procure knowledge for the creation of more perfect Genomes.
					Traits
				<traits>
						<name>Technological Instinct</name>
							Many genomes who awaken in a Genome village have an inherently advanced understanding of technology. Genomes have advantage on any check to identify a piece of machinery or diagnose a problem therein.
						<name>Isolated</name>
							Most of a genome's life after "awakening", is spent around soulless genomes, making it hard to learn to express any sort of emotion or empathy and harder still to identify it in others, taking disadvantage on all Insight checks. A humanoid's starting attitude towards genomes is one step worse than normal.
						<name>Dexterous Tail</name>
							Genomes have a long, flexible tail that can be used to carry objects. They cannot wield weapons with their tails, but they can retrieve small, stowed objects carried on their persons as a free action when paired with another action.

		</subraces>
			Hyur are the most common race, making up about 40% of the population. They have no special abilities, and have the second shortest life span of any race (roughly 60 years). Despite this, they have managed to set up large Empires and Kingdoms all over the continent and effectively achieved global dominance due to their industrious nature. Hyur can be compared with moogles in this regard, and probably have the closest relationship with the moogle than any other race, as seen in many instances when moogles are employed by hyur. However, races of all kinds inhabit hyur settlements. Hyur are also known as humans or hume.
			A Broad Spectrum
			With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elezen, roegadyn, or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.
			Variety in All Things
			Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human's memory. They live fully in the present-making them well suited to the adventuring life-but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.
			Lasting Institutions
			Where a single elezen or lalafell might take on the responsibility of guarding a special location or a powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and institutions for such purposes. While other races' elders pass on the ancient traditions to each new generation, human temples, governments, libraries, and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream of immortality, but (except for those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to escape death's clutches) they achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when they are gone. Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general their societies are inclusive. Human lands welcome large numbers of nonhumans compared to the proportion of humans who live in nonhuman lands.
			Exemplars of Ambition
			Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and ambitious members of a daring and ambitious race. They seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More than other people, humans champion causes rather than territories or groups.
			Hyur Traits
			It's hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits:

	<name>Lalafell</name>
		<subraces>
				<name>Dwarf</name>
					Dwarves are rarely seen without their face-obscuring helmets and beard-like scarves. Dwarves consider removing their helmets in front of anyone other than close relatives a taboo punishable by exile. In some areas, they are considered a beast tribe.

				</traits>
				<name>Plainsfolk</name>
					The flat landscapes of the Plainsfolk's home islands are dotted with the clan's traditional thatched huts, beneath which lie intricate networks of underground passageways. Their distinct hair coloration - a myriad of earthy and grassy tones - mimics their native environment, and their long, pointy ears are said to be able to detect the faintest scampering of the prairie's various fauna. Their skin tones tend generally toward the fairer, lighter side of the spectrum, though as with many races this is not universal.

							Lalafell value hard work and common sense. You gain proficiency with one type of tools of your choice.
				</traits>
				<name>Tarutaru</name>
					Tarutarus resemble children in size, though this does not reflect their age. In fact, they do not seem to change their appearance at all as they age. The Tarutaru are said to understand the importance of the balance between natural harmony and magic. Tarutarus lack the physical strength and durability of their fellow enlightened races as a result of their racial prejudice towards magical study, but they do control greater reserves of magical power as a result, and are the most studious and intelligent of the races.

						<name>Student of the City</name>
							Tarutarus of the city learn all they can from newcomers and tend to make contacts in all quarters. You have advantage on Persuasion or Investigation checks used to gather information in a city.
				</traits>
				<name>Dunesfolk</name>
					Perhaps the most distinctive aspect of Dunesfolk culture is its traditional dwellings - structures affixed to the backs of large beasts of burden. The luminous eyes of the Dunesfolk are the result of a glossy, protective layer which covers the pupil, an evolutionary response to the glaring sunlight of their home region. Many individuals wear a small gemstone on their forehead, representing their zodiacal sign. Dunesfolk have a particularly wide variation in skin tone - while many tend toward the darker side of the spectrum (as they live in a desert), several prominent Dunesfolk are among the fairest-skinned individuals in Ivalice.
					Traits
				<traits>
						<name>Ability Score Increase</name>
							Your Charisma score increases by 1.

						<name>Intrepid Settler</name>
							Some tarutarus add to the thrill of living by settling in precarious places. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
				</traits>
		</subraces>
			The Lalafell are a gnome-like race from the seas south of Ivalice. The race consists of the Plainsfolk, which live in thatched-roof homes and have great hearing, the Dunesfolk who live in the desert and herd animals, the Tarutaru who live in cities near the seas, and the Dwarves who live in the mountains and are masterful smiths.
			The Lalafell were originally a group of agriculturalists inhabiting the fertile islands of the south seas. With the introduction of transmarine commerce, they soon found their way to Ivalice via trade routes. They are now one of the more populous races and are well established throughout the region, though they remain averse to cold climates.
			The short, rotund builds of the Lalafell belie an incredible agility, and their seemingly feeble legs are capable of carrying them long distances over any terrain. Many among them are also known for possessing highly developed and cunning intellects.
			The Lalafell place a great deal of significance on familial bonds, but are by no means unfriendly to outsiders. This is evidenced by the fact that they continue to share prosperous relations with all of the other races of Ivalice.

	<name>Roegadyn</name>
		<subraces>
				<name>Galka</name>
					The galka are a hulking race of powerful warriors. The sheer strength of their powerful physiques is second to none. They have used their skills to contribute to the construction and development of the numerous mines. Galka are asexual and do not reproduce in the same manner as other species. However, other races typically use the male pronoun to refer to galka, as their physical appearance is more masculine than feminine. Sometime after a galka dies (between a month and a year), the galka's soul is reincarnated into a new body in a Galkan settlement. The newly reincarnated galka has no abilities or traits of the previous soul, and only hazy memories of its previous lives. Once a galka's soul has been reincarnated, the original galka cannot be raised from the dead.

				<name>Hellsguard</name>

Believing the mountains of flame to be gates to the underworld, their line has for centuries stood vigil over them to prevent the passage of souls back to the realm of the living.

					Roegadyn native to the continent of Orience differ greatly from their western cousins. While retaining their massive stature and build, Othardian Roegadyn have skin tones similar to a Hyur, and lack the flattened nose of other Roegadyn.

						<name>City-Raised</name>
							Othardians know little of their roegadyn ancestry and were raised among hyur and other othardians in a large city. City-raised othardians are proficient with shortswords and longswords.
						<name>Tenacious</name>
							City-dwelling othardians must often be tenacious to get by. Once per day, if you fail a Constitution save, Wisdom save, or Constitution check, you can reroll the save or check. You must take the second result, even if it is worse.
				</traits>
		</subraces>
			The Roegadyn are a maritime people whose largest concentrations are found in the northern seas, by way of which they came to Ivalice.
			They have enormous, muscular builds and are known for the cultural emphasis they place on competition and unflinching courage, although tender, introspective individuals can also be found. Roegadyn in and around the Lankom area are typically seamen putting in at port, but many have settled permanently, becoming mercenaries, bodyguards, or even pirates by trade. Far away, deep in the mountains of Kerwon, live mountain clans of reclusive Roegadyn known as the Hellsguard, said to have mastered the magical arts.
			Female Roegadyn have fierce faces and large muscular builds, not unlike their male kin, but they are sleeker. They are not as massive as male Roegadyn, and are a little shorter than their male counterparts, 7'3" at max height for females and 7'5" for the males.
			Traits
			Clans

					Clans

				<name>Battle-Hardened</name>
					Incessant drills make defense second nature to most roegadyns. While not wearing armor, your Armor Class is 11 plus your Dexterity modifier. You may add your proficiency modifer if you are proficient with light armor. If you are using a shield, you apply its bonus as normal.
				<name>Cornered Fury</name>

		</traits>
	<name>Miqo'te</name>
		<subraces>
				<name>Mithra</name>
					Graceful and agile, the feline Mithra hail originally from Kerwon, but crossed the great sea to fight the War of the Magi at the side of the other races of Ivalice. While Mithra, like most races, exist as both male and female, male births are exceedingly rare, and as such male mithra are normally kept locked away from the prying eyes of other races, the threats of the world, and indeed other mithra. Thus, male adventuring mithra are so rare as to be unheard of. Mithra are known for their energy and curiosity, and of course for their good-humored mischievous nature. However, they have a very short attention span so they are not keenly studious like the Tarutaru and nor are they totally tilted towards exercise like the Galka. This definite balance makes them good all round characters that can do particularly well in all fields but still never be the best as Mages or Fighters.
					Traits
				<traits>
						<name>Ability Score Increase</name>
							Your Charisma score increases by 1.
						<name>Nine Lives</name>
							Once per day, when a mithra makes a Dexterity saving throw, they can roll the saving throw twice and take the better result. You must decide to use this ability before the saving throw is attempted.
						<name>Natural Hunter</name>
							You have proficiency in the Survival and Stealth skills.
				</traits>
				<name>Keeper of the Moon</name>
					Due to their exposure to darkness, the pupils of a Keeper of the Moon Miqo'te are large and round with little iris exposure. They are distinguishable from their diurnal cousins by their darker fur, larger ears, rounder eyes, more pronounced canines, and longer, skinnier tails. The Keepers of the Moon have pale canine tails and long canines clearly visible when laughing, cheering, or most other emoting; darker-skinned Keepers tilt more toward blue and gray coloration.
					Traits
				<traits>
						<name>Keen Hearing and Smell</name>
							Keepers favor a keen sense of smell and hearing over sensitive sight. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
						<name>Cat's Claws</name>
							Because of your claws, you have a climbing speed of 20 feet. In addition, your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
						<name>Ability Score Increase</name>
							Your Intelligence score increases by 1.
				</traits>
				<name>Seeker of the Sun</name>
					Due to their exposure to light, the pupils of a Seeker of the Sun Miqo'te are vertically aligned slits with irises faintly colored. It is common for their eyes to be disparately colored from birth, a trait considered auspicious among their kind. Male Miqo'te from the Seekers of the Sun have tanned skin and have wider faces and their tails have a leonine design. The variation in Seeker skin color tends toward the more "traditional" tan coloration seen in many other races. The Seekers are widely regarded as quick-witted and prone to action, and many bore easily.
					Traits
				<traits>
						<name>Blessing of the Sun</name>
							If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
						<name>Clever Cat</name>
							Seeker's generally friendly disposition doesn't preclude craftiness. Some of them see social obstacles as games to be played and won. You are proficient in the Deception and Persuasion skills.
						<name>Ability Score Increase</name>
							Your Strength score increases by 1.
				</traits>
		</subraces>
			The Miqo'te have diverged into three ethnicities: the nearly all female Mithra, the Seekers of the Sun and the Keepers of the Moon. While the diurnal Seekers of the Sun worship Azeyma the Warden with their culture revolving around the sun, the nocturnal Keepers of the Moon prefer the shroud of night and offer their piety to Menphina the Lover. The Keepers of the Moon have a custom of applying war paint to their faces, as it is believed the vivid colors grant lunar powers. The Mithra live in cities and towns, integrating completely with Hyur society.
			Traits

			N'sss
			Like the fraal, the n'sss are aliens that have come to Alteia to conduct some unknown research. Natives of a gas-giant planet, the n'sss can enter Alteia's environment only within armored pods that serve as both life support systems and fighting machines.
			Strange Shapes
			A n'sss is not even remotely humanoid. About 4 feet long and weighing only 16 pounds, its body is composed of several inflated gas cells that provide structure and rigidity, but look like fine gossamer. A dozen long, delicate tentacles dangle from the creature's thorax, allowing it to manipulate small objects with ease and giving it the look of a jellyfish. Two enormous blue eyes provide a hint to the location of the creature's head.
			Prolific Pods
			A n'sss pod stands 12 feet tall and weighs 1,000 pounds. It maneuvers about on a dozen powerful metal tentacles that afford it considerable speed. These pods come in a variety of forms according to their function. The most common variety is dedicated to scientific research and has delicate extensions designed to take samples of different flora and fauna. Such pods seize occasional humanoid subjects as well, though their operators do not seem any more interested in the sentient life of Alteia than they do any other indigenous life form.
			Heavily armed and armored battle pods have also been spotted from time to time, typically defending the science pods as the latter go about their business. If the hull of an n'sss pod is breached, Alteia's atmospheric pressure crushes the pod's occupant into a disgusting blue mush.
			Other Visitors
			Scientists have no idea whether the n'sss are even aware of the fraal and other alien species that have made their way to Alteia, much less whether they have allied with any of those species. N'sss seem to understand but dislike magiteknology, and they typically react to anything they can't understand by either taking it apart or destroying it completely.
			N'sss Weapons
			The n'sss have developed the following alien weapons:

			These weapons are produced exclusively by the n'sss and is not available for sale in legitimate markets or on the black market.
			Render Pistol: A render pistol fires a spray of metallic needles. It can be fired ten times before reloading. Its reload ammo consists of a solid block of metal that has not yet been identified by Alteian scientists.
			Render Rifle: A render rifle is a larger version of the render pistol. It can be fired ten times before reloading.
			Cluster Rocket: Cluster rockets are grenadelike rockets fired from a large bulge on the side of an n'sss pod. They explode in a 20-foot-radius burst, dealing damage to any creatures in the area. A cluster rocket port can be fired three times before reloading.
			Neural Blade: A neural blade cuts like a sword but disrupts the target's mind as well. Any opponent that takes damage from a neural blade must make a successful Constitution save (DC 15) or be stunned for 1 round.

	<name>Fraal</name>

		</subraces>
			The Fraal (Gray)
			The fraal, dubbed "grays" by humans for the pale gray shade of their skin, first appeared in the United States in 1947, near Roswell, New Mexico. That first visit appears to have been a complete accident: A gray scout ship crashed in the desert, and the U.S. Army team that investigated the incident reported that four bodies were recovered. (Certain accounts claim that a fifth gray was found alive and taken prisoner by the army, but that rumor has never been verified.) During the decade that followed, the grays began abducting humans from North and South America, evidently for examination. According to several sources, the grays were also actively negotiating with the U.S. government for unspecified resources during this period.
			Familiar Faces
			A fraal is a small, gray-skinned humanoid with large eyes and a tiny mouth. Some grays wear suits of shimmering silvery material; others wear nothing except a belt for tools and weapons.
			Abductions and UFOs
			Tales of abduction by grays always follow the same basic script. While traveling at night, one or two people see a bright light in the sky, which often appears to hover a short distance from the ground. Upon investigating, the humans encounter a group of grays. Reports vary as to how the grays capture the humans - some victims claim to have been paralyzed by some unknown agent; others say they were enticed by a vision or sound. Invariably, however, the humans are somehow brought aboard an alien spacecraft by the little gray creatures.
			For what seems like an extraordinarily long time, the grays then perform medical examinations or experiments on the hapless humans. Sometimes these procedures are innocent examinations, sometimes they are painful and invasive, and occasionally they may even be arousing. The attitude of the aliens throughout the process varies from kindly and tolerant to cruel and impatient, depending on the account. When the examinations are over, the grays allow the humans to compose themselves, then return them to Earth - usually to the same spot from which they were taken. Often, the humans return only a few minutes after the initial encounter, even if the examinations seemed to take days.
			No one knows why the grays perform these abductions and experiments, or why they choose the people they do. Theories range from the sinister (research for biological warfare or alien eugenics programs) to the innocent (curiosity about Earth and its inhabitants, much like human scientists investigating a newly discovered species) to the sublime (taking tissue samples from which to recreate the human species after humankind wipes itself out). Occasional accounts from abductees claim that other humans - or perhaps alien-human hybrids - dwell among the grays. If true, this fact may indicate previous, unreported abductions from centuries past.
			The Truth
			The aliens known to humans as grays actually call themselves the fraal. They have come to Earth's solar system to study the long-term effects of visits from other alien species on the planet's native sentient race - humanity. The fraal wish to know whether humankind has been physically or psychologically contaminated by centuries of periodic alien contacts. To the fraal, humans are comparatively primitive life forms with an equally primitive culture. Therefore, Earth needs to be sheltered from the galactic community at large until humankind is ready for the truth.
			The fraal have visited Earth many times in the past. Some ancient accounts that mention "wheels of fire" in the sky are actually describing the peculiar configuration of fraal landing craft. In a like manner, tales of "little people" in various lands often (but not always) refer to encounters with fraal scouting parties. In fact, during ancient times, the fraal had a permanent base on a large island called Atlantis in the Aegean Sea. They shared the island peacefully with a human colony that had sprung up there. When some sort of accident destroyed the island and all its inhabitants, the remaining fraal left Earth and retreated to the outer reaches of the solar system. Eventually, though, they dared to move closer again, establishing new bases on Mars and on the dark side of Earth's moon. From these bases they periodically launch scout ships to visit Earth and bring back specimens for study.
			Despite their desire to avoid interfering with humankind's development, the fraal recognize that visits by other aliens have put humans at risk. Thus, from time to time, they provide advanced technologies that enable humans to develop better defenses. Often such benefits are simply offered directly to human governments and officials.
			Fraal Society
			Each of the three fraal city-ships based in Earth's solar system houses a distinct and separate fraal culture. Its inhabitants use the name of the city-ship to identify themselves in the same manner that humans identify themselves by nationality.
			The Ahotti ship is stationed on the moon, the Ziljir ship on Mars, and the Iltan ship in orbit between Neptune and Pluto. Of the three cultural divisions, the Iltans are the friendliest to humankind. Their task is to guard the edge of the solar system and prevent incursions by other alien visitors. For the most part, they are quite successful, though a few other aliens do slip past their defenses from time to time. The Ahotti are primarily responsible for human abductions and experiments. The Ziljirs make occasional diplomatic contacts with human governments to offer technological aid in building defenses.
			The fraal are gifted with unusual mental abilities. All of them can broadcast their own thoughts as naturally as humans can speak out loud, but those among them who work directly with humans usually develop their mental powers still further - to astounding degrees, in some cases. Scouting parties in particular are always made up of fraal with highly developed psionic abilities.
			In encounters with humans, fraal typically use suggestion or charm person to gain cooperation. If these attempts fail and the grays are sorely pressed, they defend themselves with their neural pistols.

			Height = Base Height + Height Modifier (in inches)
			Weight = Base Weight + Height Modifier (in pounds) &#215; Weight Modifier
			Personality
			Morn are cunning and charismatic. They love betting and gambling, but be wary. A morn rarely makes a bet unless he's absolutely sure he can't lose. That's not to say that they'd ever go back on their word, or break a deal. The contract is the highest law of the land, and only disgraceful morn would dare back out on one. However, it's never cheating if you don't get caught.
			Morn would only lend money if they've already made it back in profit, or you are good for what you say.
			Relations
			The morn culture places a high value on nobility, and the noble families control almost every aspect of their society. The morn have several knightly orders, both among the elyian and meridian morn.
			Meridian morn love other races. Either for potential customers, or new suckers in a bet. It's a lot easier than trying to trick other morn. Meridians get along nicely with most civilized races, including humans, tabaxi, loxodon, and viashino. They often trade with dwarves, offering them many basic goods and succulent meats in exchange for their precious metals and gems, making dwarves and meridians very close friends.
			Aonian morn are best known for their knightly traditions, having several knightly orders. They have become the sworn protectors of Amarra, and they bring justice upon those who senselessly harm the world and its inhabitants. Aonians are very close, geographically and spiritually, to meridians on Amarra. They are friendly with schaians, dwarves, and humans. Aonians detest tabaxi, and loathe the eylians.
			The original sect of morn which the elyians were born of were not a kindly sort. Driven to desperation at the actions of other races whose wars tore the planet to shreds, they tried to summon a powerful force to stop the battles, and their wish was granted... in the form of an disaster untold, the Flame of Elyia. It changed the survivors into the elyians, and left things in a mess.
			Despite the nature of their governmental theocracy, more successful families of elyian morn form mafia type business practices that are known through many type of communities and races. These families usually have large airships named after themselves that house some of the most devious types of business deals.

			</table>
			Height = Base Height + Height Modifier (in inches)
			Weight = Base Weight + Height Modifier (in pounds) &#215; Weight Modifier
			Personality
			Since their creation, drazah keep to small feudal groups akin to a tribe. These tribes are typically power vacuums waiting to happen as domination is an inborn desire for them. They are like vengeance personified if wrongs and show a burning hatred for the kingdom of humans. Reminiscent of the desertion of their neighbors when the elyians attacked, drazah are standoffish toward the morn. Drazah are very stubborn, even towards one another. They hate to be at fault and admit they are wrong. This often leads to squabbles that foil their own plans, as they have not learned of hubris and its flaws.
			Relations
			Drazah were once a proud and noble empire of morn that are eternally cursed due to experimentation that was forced upon them. Their people were offered as the bargaining chip of their ruler to a powerful arcanist in exchange for power and the opportunity to destroy their enemies. This power and opportunity was granted, but the arcanist wanted to cash in on his end of the bargain before the empire could use their gifts. As the city was being besieged, the once-proud kingdom of morn requested aid from all neighboring kingdoms, villages, even barbarian war tribes. None came to their aid, content with letting the king burn from his hubris. As the final days of the once-proud nation began, the king looked to the outskirts of his castle and saw the kingdoms he had sent aid to... watching, laughing, mocking. Since then these people have accepted their damnation, being turned into fiendish beings, and are returning to make the other descendants of man and morn pay for their abandonment.

	<Text>You cast this spell on the ship's wheel to make it 'memorize' the course you follow for the next 12 hours. The journey thus programmed into the wheel's 'memory' remains until it is replaced by a new journey or dispelled. During any future trip through this area, the wheel does not need anyone controlling it. Upon command, it can steer itself to any point stored in its 'memory'. If it passes beyond the boundary of a recorded journey, it begins to drift aimlessly until a pilot or helmsman takes hold. A ship's wheel can hold only one journey in 'memory' at a time.</Text>

				<name>Awakened Seer</name>
				<text>
					The Awakened Seer is a contradiction, they are blind, yet they see. Only their sight is an extrasensory perception that allows them to see the future with incredible accuracy. Sometimes these visions are those of victory and glory, but more often they are terrible warnings of devastating events to come.
					The Awakened Seer not only sees the future, but as they grow more and more powerful they gain the ability to alter the very fabric of fate itself. This comes at the cost of their sight, and for some Seers, their sanity.

				<name>Dreaming Seer</name>
				<text>
					The Dreaming Seer is a strange sort, sleeping to gain knowledge about the future as well as the events happening around them. When they dream they are transported to a vivid world of their own creation, wondrous but also dangerous because it can cause their grasp on the waking world to slip away.
					The Dreaming Seer has the ability to dream of the future, but as they grow more powerful they gain the ability to alter their dreamscape, walk in other places, and even transport others into their dreamscape.

					At 2nd level, you use your slight but growing precognition to amplify your quickest moments of opportunity. You have two reactions each round, and can cast a cantrip as your opportunity attack in place of weapon attacks if you choose. You can only use one reaction on any given event that allows you to use a reaction, such as only being able to make a single opportunity attack when a creature leaves your range. If the same type of trigger occurs twice however, you may use more than one reaction on the event it allows you to do (Such as a creature leaving your range twice in one turn, which is typically what allows you to attempt opportunity attacks).
					You can only cast any particular spell as a reaction once between turns, meaning spells like shield do not have their effects stack.
					At 11th level, you have three reactions, following the other rules and limitations listed above.

You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.
					Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
					You gain an additional foretelling at level 10 and level 17.

					At 13th level, you can make three weapon attacks when you use the attack action on your turn, but can still only replace one of your weapon attacks with a cantrip that requires an attack roll.

				<name>A Series of Unfortunate Events</name>
				<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>
				<text>
					At 7th level, your understanding of different possibilities allows you to literally make the best out of a bad situation. Whenever you have disadvantage on an Attack Roll, Ability Check, or Saving Throw but roll a 20 on one of the dice, you can keep the 20 as your roll. In the case of attacks, one roll of 20 is a normal hit while both is a critical, which does the maximum damage possible when it occurs this way.
				</text>
				<level>9</level>
				<name>Critical Moment</name>
				<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>
				<text>
					At 9th level, you can capitalize on your successes more, because you see them coming a mile away. Your attacks are critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20, and if you get a critical hit you may make an additional single weapon attack as a bonus action. If your opportunity attack is a critical hit, you may use another reaction to make another opportunity attack with a single weapon attack instead.
				</text>
				<level>15</level>
				<name>Most Critical Moment</name>
				<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>
				<text>
					At 15th level, you can capitalize on your opponent's failures as well, as they'll never see it coming. Your attacks are critical hits on a roll of 18, 19, or 20, and when an opponent misses you with an attack, you can make an opportunity attack as a reaction. If you hit this opportunity attack, the target of it can't target you for any attacks or spells until the end of your next turn.

				<name>Master of Fate</name>
				<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>
				<text>
					At 20th level, everything you do is so well calculated that you can basically guarantee success or failure. When you roll your foretelling dice, you may discard the lowest result and change it to a 1 or a 20.

				<level>1</level>
				<name>The Third Eye</name>
				<specialization>Awakened Seer</specialization>
				<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>
				<text>
					At 1st level, you are blind, either as an accident, birth defect or an intentional choice to pursue this power. As such, you always suffer the Blind Status Aliment, and cannot be cured of it through normal means, including normal spells. Spells work as effectively as if you could see (except those requiring an attack roll are still made at disadvantage from your blindness, foresight still gives you advantage instead of merely negating your disadvantage on attacks, for example), but those that need you to see specific targets of the spell require you to know where those targets are in some way (such as hearing them or feeling them), or accurately guessing where they are in relation to you (if you guess and miss, the spell is wasted). Spells that give you some measure of temporary vision lock off your foresight, causing you to be unable to use any of your seer class features other than those unrelated to seeing (like spellcasting, proficiencies, etc) until you are blind once again; but of that same vein, since this blindness is now part of who you are nothing can restore your vision if you are unwilling to allow it, short of a deity. If an overdeity restores your vision, whether temporarily or permanently, you keep your seer class features, depending on the disposition of the deity. You can still read and write in your spellbook in spite of your blindness, along with any Seer Spellbook or Spell Scroll (if the scroll has a Seer spell on it). Your blindness makes you more in tune with the weight of weapons, allowing you to add your Wisdom modifier to attack and damage rolls made with Heavy weapons instead of your Strength modifier.

				<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>
				<text>
					At 1st level, you have learned to see possible futures while awake, as a result of being blind. You are immune to the Suprised Status, always roll Initiative before the first attack occurs, and you can use your reaction at the start of Initiative to warn everyone that can hear you of the threat, preventing them from being Suprised. Additionally, you may provide one willing target with advantage on their Initiative roll when warning them this way.

				<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>
				<text>
					At 6th level, your grasp on the weave of fate has strengthened to the point that you can alter it slightly. Once per short rest, you may use one of your foretelling rolls to instead provide advantage or disadvantage on any roll.
				</text>
				<level>14</level>
				<name>Eyes Wide Shut</name>
				<specialization>Awakened Seer</specialization>
				<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>
				<text>
					At 14th level, you are so good at seeing the future that you can glimpse a mere moment ahead, effectively allowing you to see very near to the present. You can navigate on your own as if you could see, regardless of the amount of light present, and no longer have disadvantage on skill checks and saving throws as a result of being blind, nor do enemies have advantage on their attacks because of you being blind. Finally, you gain proficiency in Wisdom Saving Throws, if you do not have it already.

				<name>The Blind Prophet</name>
				<specialization>Awakened Seer</specialization>
				<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>
				<text>
					At 18th level, you have truly mastered the art of foretelling. When you finish a long rest, roll five d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.
					Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
					Additionally, you gain an additional use of Twist Fate per short rest.

				<text>
					At 1st level, you are more susceptible to being really tired. If caught in an effect that can make you fall asleep, you do automatically, regardless of if you could resist against or be immune to the effect. This includes the sleep spell and similar effects, regardless of if the spell rolls high enough to knock you unconscious (but still wastes the hit points if you are caught in it). In addition, you have disadvantage on saving throws that cause Exhaustion on a failure. Your constant sleepiness makes you go with the flow more, allowing you to add your Charisma modifier to attack and damage rolls made with Heavy weapons instead of your Strength modifier.

				<level>1</level>
				<name>Memetic Dreamscape</name>
				<specialization>Dreaming Seer</specialization>
				<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>
				<text>
					At 1st level, your mind no longer simply dreams, instead when you sleep you are transported to a vivid and shifting dreamscape of your own design. While inside this dreamscape, you have perfect recall as you are able to peruse your memories as though they were books on a shelf or boxes of papers filed away. Additionally, any Insight or Investigation checks made within the dreamscape to discern knowledge from your memories is made with advantage and the effects and range of the scrying spell are doubled.

				<name>Prophetic Dreams</name>
				<specialization>Dreaming Seer</specialization>
				<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>
				<text>
					At 6th level, your dreams become more clear and focused, allowing you to see upcoming events through a window in the dreamscape. Once per short rest you may allow yourself or a friendly target that you can see the ability to reroll a failed Saving Throw. The new result must be kept.
				</text>
				<level>14</level>
				<name>Dreamwalker</name>
				<specialization>Dreaming Seer</specialization>
				<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>
				<text>
					At 14th level you have gained the ability to step from your own dreamscape into other worlds, while you are within your dreamscape you may cast astral projection without needing material components or expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't take other creatures with you.
					In addition, you have advantage on Charisma Saving throws. This effect extends outside of your dreamscape.
				</text>
				<level>18</level>
				<name>Master of Dreams</name>
				<specialization>Dreaming Seer</specialization>
				<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>
				<text>
					At 18th level you have become the master of your dreamscape such that you can go there physically. Once per long rest you can transport yourself and up to 10 willing creatures within 30 feet of you into your dreamscape for one hour. Every creature targeted by this ability falls under the effects of the sleep spell and regains consciousness within your dreamscape. After one hour has passed (in the waking world, keep in mind that time may differ wildly within the dreamscape), all the targets awaken.
					While using this ability, you may also take creatures with you via your Dreamwalker feature, however the effect still ends at the one hour mark.

				<specializationchoice>0</specializationchoice>
				<text>
					As a magically empowered seer, you can use your uncanny foresight to predict what mistakes you could make trying to cast spells, and avoid them, allowing you to cast such spells. All Seer Class spells are considered arcane for seers, including those that normally are with classes that use divine or natural magic. See the bottom of the page for the unique seer class Spell List.
					Cantrips
					At 1st level, you know 2 cantrips from the seer spell list. You learn additional seer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Seer table.
					Spellbook
					At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level seer spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the seer spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.
					For the purposes of multiclassing, separate sections, parted by 10 blank pages, can be used to have a single spellbook with wizard and seer spells on it. Your spellbook has all the other limitations of a spellbook for the wizard class, which you can reference in the &#34;Your Spellbook&#34; sidebar on page 114 of the 5e PHB. Copying spells from a Wizard's spellbook as a Seer spell is possible, and so is copying Seer spells into a Wizard spellbook, but only if the spell is on both spell lists. If you have a Seer spell in your spellbook that is also on the Wizard spell list and you have Wizard levels, you can cast the spell as a Wizard spell provided you have the spellslot to do so, and vice versa.
					It costs 10 gold and 30 minutes per level of the spell to copy a divination spell into your spellbook, rather than the normal time and cost requirements. This doesn't stack with the Wizard's Divination Savant feature.
					Preparing And Casting Spells
					The Seer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level or higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a spell slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of seer spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of seer spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your seer level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level seer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level spell slot. Casting a spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of seer spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
					Spellcasting Ability
					Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your seer spells, since you learn your spells through intense mental training and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a seer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
					Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
					Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
					Ritual Casting
					You can cast a seer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.
					Spellcasting Focus
					You can use an arcane focus (see 5e PHB chapter 5, &#34;Equipment&#34;) as a spellcasting focus for your seer spells.
					Learning Spells of 1st level And Higher
					Each time you gain a seer level, you can add two seers spell of your choice to your spellbook for free. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Seer Table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see 5e PHB &#34;Your Spellbook&#34; sidebar on page 114).
					When you reach 17th level, you gain the foresight spell for free, in addition to 2 seer spells of your choice. The foresight spell can be cast without having to memorize it or have it in your spellbook.

					If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>
					Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.
					Spells Known and Prepared. You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
					Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
					Spell Slots. You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
					If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
					For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.
					Pact Magic. If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

			Seer
			Once I knew only darkness and stillness...my life was without past or future...but a little word from the fingers of another fell into my hand that clutched at emptiness, and my heart leaped to the rapture of living.&#10; -Nhell Elkere, the High Seer of Azeria
			A woman sits in an empty stone room, her friends in the middle of enjoying their latest in a string of lucky victories. Of course, it never was luck, not that they'd ever know that. She meditates, soundless, motionless, determined to learn of something she knows she had missed. Next time, no one dies. Maybe next time.
			A child awakens with a fright after having a terrible nightmare of a flood that would destroy a whole forest. But it wasn't a nightmare, and he knows that. If only he could have woken up 5 minutes sooner, then it wouldn't already be raining. He has exactly 33 minutes, 52 seconds, and 98 milliseconds. And he knows it.
			An elderly man sits atop the throne he stole. Lesser creatures would be so eager to spend the earnings, but he knows that a kingdom is worthless if it falls. He knows every threat that will envelope the place for the short time left he has, and knows how to fight back against it. Not himself of course, what does he look like, an amateur?
			Living in the Future
			Seers are people that dedicate their lives to pursuing a specific outlet for their magical prowess. That specific outlet is the control over fate that seeing the future can provide, though it typically comes at a grave cost of being incredibly frail, since the training and mental exercising that is required for this both takes up all your free time and allows for little in the way of staying in shape. Worse yet, practicing for so long can make it difficult or even impossible for some seers to live for the present, always instinctively making plans for the possibilities they think of even when the dangers seem to of passed. Hopefully you'll become powerful enough to fix that, but it's very well possible that you won't live that long. Seers are often the target of good and evil creatures alike trying to steal the edge that comes with this ability, and without being either secretive or very clever about using your powers, you could easily get in over your head.
			Creating a Seer
			When making a Seer, ask yourself what made them pursue this path over other, less tedious (It typically takes years for most seers to harness their craft, longer than most Wizards) options? What does having so little contact with others outside of your seeing do to you? Who or what granted you the power to even try? It's likely you'll want to have some of these answers tucked away, so you should get the motivation and consequences of trying to be a seer integrated as early as you can.

			<text>
				You have studied long and hard, learning to condense the remaining Aether from your spells into power creatures summoned from your mind.
				Each time you cast a spell or a cantrip, you gain a point of Condensation. Upon reaching three points of Condensation, as an action you may expend a number of your Condensation Points and a spell slot to summon an Aetheric Creature (see the list below) to fight for you in battle for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier plus the level of the spell slot you spent to summon the creature. The creature appears at a spot you can see within 30 feet of you. Holding the creature together with your mind requires you to maintain Concentration similar to casting a spell. While concentrating on maintaining the summoned creature, you can use your action to direct the creature to take a movement action, attack action, and bonus action (a standard turn). The creature operates immediately after your initiative and obeys your commands completely. If you do not use your action to issue a command, the creature maintains its position and makes attacks of opportunity or other reactions if it is able.
				While not all summoned creatures require three Condensation points, you must have three Condensation points to summon a creature. Additionally, you may accrue Condensation points while you have an active Aetheric Creature. You may not have more than three Condensation points at one time and any Condensation points that you have gained are lost upon taking a short or long rest.
				If a summoned creature is destroyed, is placed into a different Plane from you, or moves more than a number of feet equal to your Charisma modifier multiplied by 100, it and any items that it was wielding dissapate back into the Aether. Additionally, any items carried by the creature dissapate if they are separated from it.

				As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See the information below for the summoner spell list.
				Cantrips
				At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the summoner spell list. You learn additional summoner cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Summoner table.
				Spellbook
				At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level summoner spells of your choice.
				Preparing and Casting Spells
				The summoner table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
				You prepare the list of summoner spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of summoner spells from your spellbook equal to your Wisdom modifier + your summoner level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
				For example, if you're a 3rd-level summoner, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
				You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of summoner spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
				Spellcasting Ability
				Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your summoner spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
				In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a summoner spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
				Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
				Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
				Ritual Casting
				You can cast a summoner spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.
				Spellcasting Focus
				You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your summoner spells.
				Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher
				Each time you gain a summoner level, you can add two summoner spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the summoner table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &quot;Your Spellbook&quot; sidebar).
				Your Spellbook
				The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.
				Copying a Spell into the book. When you find a summoner spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. The spells copied into a spellbook must be of a spell level the summoner can prepare.
				Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the summoner who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.
				For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.
				Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many summoners keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
				The Book's Appearance Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.
				A spellbook doesn't contain cantrips.

				At 18th level, you have achieved mastery over certain summoned creatures. You are able to have one Aetheric Creature of up to CR 1 manifested at all times. Additionally, maintaining this creature does not occupy your concentration. You may use your action or bonus action to direct this creature or another summoned creature if you are maintaining concentration on manifesting a second creature.
				If the bonded creature is destroyed, you must wait 1d4+1 days before you can manifest another creature in this manner.

		Summoner
		An elf stands atop a hill, a massive grey beast at her side. With a glance and a command from the slender elven woman, the beast charges down the hill and wades into a line of enemy combatants unleashing a murderous rampage.
		A human man hurls spells for a moment and stops, a carbuncle and a pixie appear at his side. The pixie confounds his foes as the carbuncle unleashes a ray from his shoulder into the enemy combatants.
		An orc with a tome stand behind a group of battleworn allies, with a burst of light, his summoned creature transforms into a winged celestial that begins to aid the party with restorative magics.
		All of these are summoners, a conjurer of monsters with spellcasting abilities focusing on utility.
		Summoners have a long and storied history, they are known throughout the world as healers, court mages, and of course conjurers of great and powerful monsters. For while they are talented healers and spellcasters, the calling of monsters from the aether is their true skill.
		All summoners have their own approach, some opt to go for the quality over quantiy route, summoning multiple monsters to do their bidding while others choose to empower single creatures. Others still choose to learn the flow of aether through themselves and their summoned creatures in order to provide healing to their friends and comrades.
		Summoner Faiths
		Some summoner faiths even go as far as worshipping the creatures that they summon, building complex rituals around their summoning, and many summoners are devout followers of one of the many deities in the world.
		These facts, and the facts that the summoned creatures, while bound to the bidding of the summoner are still conscious creatures, means that there are very few evil summoners to be found. One would have to be truly cruel to be an evil summoner.
		Perhaps the most well known faith of summoners is that of the callers. They worship the Aetheric Creatures, believing that the souls of the summoners that have come before them have gone on to become great Aetheric Creatures which they call Aeons. Their faith is ritualistic and dogmatic, and their training is quite strict.
		Aetheric Creatures
		The Aetheric Creatures that summoners conjure have many names in many places, they might be called any number of things. They are known around the world as Aeons, Animas, Archons, Espers, Eidolons, Eikons, Guardian Forces, and Primals, just to name a few.
		Quick Build
		You can make a summoner quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom, and then Constitution. Secondly, choose the acolyte, folk hero, or sage background.

				Archery
				You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
				Defense
				While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
				Dueling

				Great Weapon Fighting
				When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
				Protection
				When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.
				Two-Weapon Fighting

				Additionally, your tactical focus allows you to capitalize on moments of opportunity in battle that others wouldn't even notice. When you make the attack action on your turn, you may use your bonus action to grant yourself advantage on an attack, however you do not gain the +2 bonus to attack rolls when advantage is gained this way. Once you have used this ability you cannot do so again until you have completed a long rest.

				Beginning at 2nd level, you can spend time imbuing a weapon or armor with wind magic to enhance it. By spending 1 hour focusing on a weapon or armor, you can imbue it with one of the benefits below. You may only have one weapon and one armor or shield imbued at a time. If you enter or are affected by an anti-magic field, these benefits no longer function.
				Air Blade (weapon enhancement)
				When you use the Attack action on your turn, as a bonus action, you can cause one of your attacks with this weapon to deal an additional 1d4 slashing damage.
				Aura Knife (weapon enhancement)
				Attacks made with this weapon deal an additional point of psychic damage and are considered magical for the purposes of overcoming damage resistance.
				Wind's Insight (weapon enhancement)
				When you attack with this weapon, you can use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls.
				Grace of Air (armor enhancement)
				While wearing this armor or shield, you may add 1 + your Wisdom modifier to your AC instead of your Dexterity modifier.
				Lightness of a Breeze (armor enhancement)
				While wearing this medium armor, it no longer limits your Dexterity bonus to your AC. Alternatively, when using this shield, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on a ranged attack.
				Hidden by Wind (armor enhancement)
				While wearing this armor, it no longer imposes disadvantage on Stealth checks. Alternatively, when using this shield, you can use your action to gain cover from the shield.
				When you reach 13th level, you may have a number of items imbued at the same time equal to your Wisdom modifier.

				Starting at 3rd level, you manifest magic, and unleash it through your weapon; your training allows you to do this without the aid of a spellbook.
				Cantrips
				At 3rd level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the spellblade spell list. You learn additional spellblade cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Spellblade table.
				Spell Slots
				The Spellblade table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spellblade spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spellblade spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
				For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.
				Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
				You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the spellblade spell list.
				The Spells Known column of the Spellblade table shows when you learn more spellblade spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 4th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st level.
				Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spellblade spells you know and replace it with another spell from the spellblade spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
				Spellcasting Ability
				Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your spellblade spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spellblade spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
				Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
				Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
				Spellcasting Focus
				You can use a weapon or an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your spellblade spells.

		An elven woman stands on a sand dune, clad head to toe in cloth, with her scimitar in hand looking down at a group of five approaching horsemen trailing a plume of dust behind them. If they could see her face behind her veil, they would know that she is smiling. She has read the sands, and her eyes are no longer bothered by the dust the horsemen have kicked up. She slides down the dune to meet them, maybe if they had twenty more, she would face a challenge.
		A dark-skinned initiate in scale mail with a sword and shield faces down against seven heavily-armored soldiers. The soldiers all wait warily and tensely for the initiate to make a move, they've already lost three of their number to this combatant. Suddenly the man erupts in a flurry of attacks; catching them off guard and pressing his new tactical advantage, the dark-skinned initiate quickly dispatches three more of them with his attacks before turning and unleashing a blade of arcane energy beneath the feet of two others that cleaves them in twain. The remaining two soldiers glance at one another and then at the initiate, a moment passes, and the two men flee into the halls of the keep.
		A human man with long dark hair wearing dark ringmail and a nobly cut forest green velvet cloak strides down a corridor, glancing at the servants and staff of the noble's estate, wondering if any of them suspect the coming storm. He decides that they do not, he had used false credentials and a fake name to gain entry after all. Finally, he reaches the door he's looking for and enters. Inside a very well dressed and bejeweled middle-aged man awaits. As the dark-haired man closes the door, he draws his dagger and begins to cast a spell. Tonight, there will be a storm in this castle, a storm of serpents swarming, stabbing, and spewing secrets to gain power from this well-appointed man's death.
		These are spellblades, a martial spellcaster class for use with the 5th Edition ruleset.
		The Spellblade
		The spellblade is a martial spellcaster, or a class that uses both weapons and magic. While it does not get as many spells as other classes, it makes up for this with martial acumen and versatility, as a spellblade can fill a variety of rolls depending on their spell selection and sacred order choices.
		Quick Build
		You can make a spellblade quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score. Make Strength or Dexterity your next-highest based on the style of combat you prefer. Second, choose the soldier or hermit background.

		<frame>An important note about the targeting of Armaments spells: While the character is making a melee attack, they are able to make that melee attack at range even if their weapon does not have that range. Additionally, while some spells have names that include words like &quot;sword&quot; or &quot;blade&quot; they do not require that the caster be wielding a sword or other edged weapon.</frame>
